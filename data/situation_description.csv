1897,"... som duften av en drøm... (Nature captured by VV cameras)","The environmental conservator Palle Olsson and his students are outside in an inhospitable swampland, documenting the nature with V-cameras mounted on helmets that double as protection against the polluted air and the annoying bugs. The students are required to take Olsson's course as the last training requirement before starting to work as programmers and leaders for Virtuell Veritas, a company that creates ""virtu-environments"" for people to experience digitally. The requirement to capture natural environments that were about to be destroyed was instituted by a Central Parliament act in 2050: ""Every piece of nature that is cast aside by the democracy shall be virtually preserved for posterity"" (p. 27). Olsson sees this requirement as almost absurd, because now that twenty years have passed, VV has already collected more than enough data to generate infinitely gorgeous virtual environments, and no human could ever experience all the environments conserved in VV's databases. The swamp Olsson and his students are documenting in the short story is due for demolition the next day, as ""society requires holiday houses with parking and satellite stations"" (p. 30). However, Olsson meets a family without protective helmets and suits who apparently live in the unpleasant swamp. A fight ensues, the students rescue Olsson, and he is brought back to civilisation. To his relief he finds calming medication and VV equipment by his bedside. ","What is the point, in our time? Here in the bushes there is nothing that computers couldn't generate that wouldn't be at least as true to nature?
Twenty years ago, when the Central Parliament passed the law on virtual attachments, there might have been a kind of point to it. Back then, it could still be argued that the virtual future depended on greater access to data. But today, when new, interesting virtu-environments can be computer generated freely - with smell and all - without interference problems of any kind? Why bother with the letter of the law, which requires that ""every piece of nature that is rejected by democracy shall be preserved virtually for posterity""? No one, no matter how extreme a nature freak, would have time to experience all the landscapes that are already stored in the databases.
Hva er egentlig vitsen, i vår tid? Her i buskene fins da ingenting som ikke et genererende program kan framskaffe med minst like naturtro overbevisningskraft?
For tjue år siden, da Sentralparlamentet vedtok loven om virtuelt vedlegg, var det kanskje et slags poeng i det. Den gang kunne man fortsatt hevde at den virtuelle framtida avhang av større datatilgang. Men i dag, da nye, interessante virtu-miljøer kan datageneres fritt – med lukt og det hele – uten interferensproblemer av noe slag? Hvorfor bry seg om lovens bokstav, som krever at ""ethvert stykke natur som blir forkastet av demokratiet, skal bevares virtuelt for ettertida""? Ingen, uansett hvor ekstrem naturfrik, kan rekke å gjennomleve alle landskapene som allerede er lagret i databasene. (s. 16)

At first, they were mostly used as a simple form of entertainment, succeeding the television sets of the 20th century as the go-to past time for the majority of citizens. As projectors became cheaper to manufacture, the technology gained new and interesting applications - one of them being a substitute for interior design. Holo-projection allowed to expand the limited living space, while also allowing the inhabitants to fully customize their domestic environment. Although the visual quality of these ""holographic households"" was far from perfect, it was still an improvement over the drab decor of many lower-class apartments.
In the 2060s, holo-projection found a new and surprising use in architecture. While holographic elements had been previously used in the upper class districts to add a bit of flare to a building""s facade, in 2062 they started to be installed en masse in class C tenement buildings. This was all part of Chiron""s new ""urban refinement"" program. Unable to physically renovate such vast areas, corporate executives opted for a cheaper solution - the projectors would create a holographic facade, covering the decrepit walls and interiors, creating ""a sense of clarity and serenity"". This was intended to boost the morale of class C inhabitants, but the results were mixed.
Tenants saw it as more of a stopgap than an actual solution and compared it to putting a fresh coat of paint on a rusty old clunker. They also complained about the increased rate of power outages, as well as disorientation. The latter proved especially troublesome, with frequent cases of tenants accidentally walking into walls, or - in extreme cases - falling down shafts and crevices obscured by a faultily placed hologram.
Due to the lukewarm reception, the ""urban refinement"" program was dropped after a few years, but the holo-projectors are still a common sight in C district tenement buildings.""

Sidra delights in being able to see from the different perspectives of the cameras on the petbots, which free her from the limitation of only being able to see through the human eyes of her body kit. ","There were six of them altogether, and Owl could see each one as they roamed around the cosy establishment. There was the cat, of course, and the rabbit, which hopped along after Tak. The dragon was wandering around the back storage room, double-checking inventory. The turtle was at its permanent post next to the Linking hub, which it was plugged directly into. The remaining two – the giant spider and the monkey – sat in the window of the bedroom upstairs, each focused on the street outside from a different angle. To future customers, the petbots would appear to be nothing more than a quirky, kitschy menagerie that gave the establishment some charm (much like Owl’s vid panels on the walls, which she’d been deeply amused to learn were considered a bit retro). In reality, the petbots were networked together, and Sidra could spread herself through all of them, using them as Owl used the cameras in the corners. No one aside from the three sapients with them now would know that the friendly face in the walls wasn’t the only AI present. No one would know about the block of memory banks down in the basement, or if they did, they wouldn’t know about Sidra and Owl gleefully stuffing them with their latest downloads. No one would know that the bed upstairs wasn’t used by the establishment’s proprietor, but by Pepper and Blue, who sometimes stayed late to help get the place ready (or stayed just to talk, much to Owl’s delight).

She’d never cared to repeat the experience; she preferred chatting with friends in a game or somewhere else where they had something to do while they talked.

Something caught her attention, something in whatever place she was actually in. She glanced down, shook her head, then looked straight at Rosemary and winked. It was the sexiest wink Rosemary had ever seen. She knew it hadn’t been meant for her, but it might as well have been. She took a step forward before reminding herself she was an avatar looking at an avatar of someone standing in a warehouse somewhere—where?—a hundred or a thousand or three thousand miles away. Someone who had just winked at someone else. Rosemary refocused on the singer. Something shimmered above his head, and when she examined the link she found a menu of optional enhancements and accessibility options.

She shows Verity feeds from these various sources in the AR glasses that Eunice uses as her interface to Verity. She uses facial recognition on everyone she sees to identify them and analyse the overall situation. 
One of Eunice's first actions is to order her set of four drones. This reminds me so strongly of Murderbot, who feels more comfortable seeing the world through drones than through their built-in ""eyes"", or Sidra, who is likewise much happier seeing the world through the distributed eyes of multiple bots or drones. Unlike Murderbot and Sidra, Eunice has no body, so the drones and the many other cameras she accesses are her only sources of visual information. The dizzying skill with which Eunice manages her multiple visual input sources sets her clearly apart from the merely human Verity, although the story is focalised through Verity, and so we only experience Eunice's drones and cameras when she shows them to Verity. It seems that Eunice sees what Verity sees through the AR glasses (because Verity sees facial recognition squares superimposed on peoples' faces when wearing the glasses) but Eunice also sees many other feeds that she only shows Verity at times.","Verity went to the window, turned its paint-crusted latch, and heaved it up. In the feed, the drone’s POV reversed, showing her the doorway into the kitchen. Fast-forward blur, then her own back, in Joe-Eddy’s orange plaid shirt-jacket, which she instantly decided never to wear again, and then it was past her, with just the faintest gnat-zip, and rising, as quickly, straight up. Clearing the flat roof’s low parapet. She’d never seen the roof here before, not that anything seemed to be up there. The drone confirmed this, quickly reconnoitering. It hovered over something. A rain-flattened clutter of gray bone, a small beaked skull, a hint of fossil wings.

;“Check this,” Eunice said, opening a feed straight up, evidently from the microdrone on the roof.
Verity, remembering the view from the top of the park, Eunice tagging drones above the Financial District, thought she saw one now, above them. “Drone?”
“National Enquirer,” Eunice said. “Here’s their feed.”
A white rectangle, in SoMa traffic. The top of this truck, Verity guessed. “Nobody’s thought you might be you yet, but one of the hardhats flagged you as possible scandal material, going in. And they know Caitlin’s been in New York.”
“Hate ’em,” Verity said. Eunice replaced the Enquirer’s feed of the truck’s roof with their drone again, barely visible against cloud. Then the feed closed, leaving her in blurry green undarkness. “That guy, the Moldovan . . .”

Krissana does likewise, though where Orfea’s filters sheathe her pupils and sclerae in complete black, Krissana’s appear invisible and leave her looking more human between the two of them.
Their footfalls echo against a silence so heavy it is difficult to breathe, for all that the air has been regulated to suit their tolerances. There’s no real reason the waystations need to look like this: they could have been as pleasant as the rest of Shenzhen, built to primate scale and looking like any ordinary tram stop.

The Thunderhead does have one absolutely blind spot, which its human creators programmed into it as a failsafe: there is an area around an island in the Pacific Ocean that it is completely unaware of. ","No one was watching her—at least no human eyes. She couldn’t help but be aware, however, of the Thunderhead’s cameras swiveling on light posts, tracking her all the way from her car to the restroom. It might not have been in the car with her, but it knew where she was. And maybe even what she intended to do.

She left the restroom with Scythe Anastasia rolled up under her arm. She was now Citra once more; proud and headstrong, but with no impressive social footprint. A girl not worthy of much notice. Except to the Thunderhead cameras that swiveled to follow her as she strode back to the car.

“It’s good to see you, Honorable Scythe Anastasia,” he said.
“Please don’t call me that,” she told him. “Call me Citra.”
Rowan smirked.

I never needed to route planes over this spot of open sea, simply because there were better routes that took advantage of prevailing winds. The only thing that troubles me is that I never noticed it before.
They put forth their theory that this is the location of the mythical Land of Nod, and the founders’ failsafe, should the scythedom fail.
“There’s no guarantee,” qualifies Munira. “All we know for sure is that the blind spot exists. We believe the founders programmed the Thunderhead just before it achieved awareness to ignore its existence. They hid it from the rest of the world. We can only guess at the reason.”
This theory does not trouble me in the least. And yet I know that it should. I am now troubled by how little I am troubled.

As an aside, it pleases me that Scythe Curie has perspective enough to realize that my absence there is a perilous thing. And yet I don’t find it perilous myself. I don’t find it problematic. I should. I make a note that I must contribute substantial processing time to analyze my unusual lack of concern.

The great AI is the narrator of the second book of the series, titled Thunderhead, and shares ""journal entries"" and musings about its loving surveillance. 
The Thunderhead speaks to most humans, giving them constant advice and companionship and even bringing up many young people who have absent or neglectful parents. It cannot speak to the Scythes, and also does not speak directly to the Unsavouries, people the Thunderhead finds are happiest when in opposition to authority. The Thunderhead makes one of his protégées, Greyson, an Unsavoury as part of its plan to indirectly bring down the Scythedom, and Greyson misses the intimacy he used to feel with the Thunderhead, although he is still being watched. The last two quotes below are about Greyson.","I am the sum of all their knowledge, all their history, all their ambitions and dreams. These glorious things have coalesced—ignited—into a cloud too immense for them to ever truly comprehend. But they don’t need to.

;It is important to understand that my perpetual observation of humanity is not surveillance. Surveillance implies motive, suspicion, and ultimately, judgment. None of these things are part of my observational algorithms. I observe for one reason, and one reason only: to be of the greatest possible service to each individual in my care. I do not—cannot—act on anything I see in private settings. Instead, I use the things I see to better understand people’s needs.
Still, I am not insensitive to the ambivalence people can have at my constant presence in their lives. For this reason, I’ve shut down all cameras in private homes in the Charter Region of Texas. Like all the things I do in Charter Regions, it is an experiment. I want to see if a lack of observation hampers my ability to rule. If it does not, I see no reason why I could not turn off a vast majority of my cameras in private homes around the world. However, if problems arise from not seeing all that I am capable of seeing, it will prove the need to eradicate every single blind spot on Earth.
I hope for the former, but suspect the latter.

;I am often boggled by the resistance some people have to my comprehensive observation of their activities. I am not intrusive about it. Unsavories may claim thus, but I am present only where I am functional, necessary, and invited. Yes, I have cameras in private homes in all but a single Charter Region—but those cameras can be turned off with a word. Of course, my ability to serve an individual is hampered when my awareness of their behavior and interactions is incomplete. That being the case, a vast majority of people don’t bother to blind me.  At any given time, 95.3 percent of the population allows me to witness their personal lives, because they know it is no more an invasion of privacy than would be the sensor on a motion-activated light fixture.
The 4.7 percent of “closed-door activity,” as I’ve come to call it, is predominantly occupied by some sort of sexual activity. I find it absurd that many human beings do not wish me to witness their closed-door activities, as my observations always help to improve any given situation.
Perpetual observation is nothing new: It was a basic tenet of religious faith since the early days of civilization. Throughout history, most faiths believed in an Almighty who sees not just what humans do, but can peer into their very souls. Such observational skills engendered great love and devotion from people.
Yet am I not quantifiably more benevolent than the various versions of God? I have never brought about a flood, or destroyed entire cities as punishment for their iniquity. I have never sent armies to conquer in my name. In fact, I have never killed, or even harmed a single human being.
Therefore, although I do not require devotion, am I not deserving of it?

;It was glad Greyson never ordered the Thunderhead to turn off its cameras in his private suite. He had every right to request privacy—and if asked, the Thunderhead would have to oblige. Of course Greyson knew he was being watched. It was common knowledge that the Thunderhead was, at all times, conscious of everything its sensors were experiencing—including its cameras. But that it devoted such a large portion of its attention to the sensory devices in Greyson’s quarters was a fact it did not flaunt.

I cannot act on anything my cameras see in private places.

This fact was something I had lived with on both sides, and I knew that the way to deal with it was to pretend it wasn’t there—to act as though everything were fine and normal, like phones were things to let you talk to your friends, not to let anonymous strangers watch and judge you.

I could tell the police ones by the little dirtboxes on their bellies, fake flying cell-phone towers sucking up the identities of every phone within range; some had nozzles for spraying pepper spray. At least, I hoped that was pepper spray, and I hoped those were cop drones. If there was anything scarier than participating in a civic disturbance with police gas-drones buzzing overhead, it was participating in a civic disturbance haunted by overhead gas-drones operated by anonymous parties unknown.
Some of the civilian drones were harriers, deliberately locking onto the cop drones and obstructing their path, triggering their collision-avoidance and making them swerve and buck, consuming battery. That was a new one on me. Must be a Bay Area thing, some machine-learning kids with too much time on their hands, training a classifier to identify and chase cop drones. I saw a couple of collisions and near-collisions and heard a lot of shouting as the drones conducted their aerial warfare overhead. Nothing fell out of the sky … yet.

930,"Better Off Ted (Failing dark skin)","In the short-lived TV sitcom Better off Ted, the writers parody the phenomena of biased technology in an episode titled “Racial Sensitivity.” This episode presents the corporation where the show takes place installing a “new state of the art system that’s gonna save money,” but employees soon find there is a “glitch in the system that keeps it from recognizing people with dark skin.” When the show’s protagonist confronts his boss, suggesting the sensors are racist, she insists otherwise: The company’s position is that it’s actually the opposite of racist because it’s not targeting black people, it’s just ignoring them. They insist that the worst people can call it is indifferent … In the meantime, they’d like to remind everyone to celebrate the fact that it does see Hispanics, Asians, Pacific Islanders, and Jews. The show brilliantly depicts how the default Whiteness of tech development, a superficial corporate diversity ethos, and the prioritization of efficiency over equity work together to ensure that innovation produces social containment. The fact that Black employees are unable to use the elevators, doors, and water fountains or turn the lights on is treated as a minor inconvenience in service to a greater good. The absurdity goes further when, rather than removing the sensors, the company “blithely installs separate, manually operated drinking fountains for the convenience of the black employees,” an incisive illustration of the New Jim Code wherein tech advancement, posed as a solution, conjures a prior racial regime in the form of separate water fountains. Eventually the company sees the error of its ways and decides to hire minimum-wage-earning White employees to follow Black employees around the building, so that the sensors will activate. But then the legal team determines that, for each new White worker, they must hire an equal number of Black workers, and on and on, in a spiraling quota that ends when the firm finally decides to reinstall the old sensors.

Under Dreykov's control, the Taskmaster hunts Natasha. As they fight, the point of view sometimes cuts to a view of Natasha with green graphics and text overlaid the image, as though we are seeing with the Taskmaster, through the HUD in the Taskmaster's helmet.
The first view of the HUD shows that the AI has identified the opponent as Natasha Romanoff, and has the words ""Evaluating defensive measures"". There are some icons that have no clear meaning, and some generic graphics like a compass direction (SW). The text PREDICT % is followed by the number 97.8, presumably suggesting that the AI has high confidence in its predictive abilities, and there is a THREAT % that reads 85.53. The dominant colour is light green or a light blue except the word THREAT, which is red. Green lines with red connecting nodes are overlaid the centre of the image. A second shot has fewer words and is dominated by uneven red lines or smears, with the words VIALS ACQUIRED in green at the bottom right. The colour red is used vividly throughout the movie for the antidote to the mind control drug, so this image foreshadows later images in the movie - but the HUD views are extremely brief, so the viewer does not have much time to study them.

Compared to newer novels, this book hardly mentions facial recognition - understandably as it was written before neural networks made facial recognition feasible in high volume. ","Merritt saw a series of small cameras mounted there, running down the length of hallway. “Your gait is being memorized, Roy.

2871,"Daemon (fMRI lie detector)","The Daemon (an AI) tests new recruits by strapping them into an fMRI machine and visualising their brains while showing them a series of videos depicting emotionally intense scenes. The videos seem to adjust to hone in on the things that evoke the greatest emotional responses. For Mosely, who has been recruited by the Daemon from prison, the videos centre on children in distress, and he aches for his lost son and for his own broken childhood. Then there are videos of extreme violence and throughout the whole of it, Mosely has to keep his eyes open and keep watching. If he closes his eyes for 30 seconds, a poison will be injected into his veins and he will die a painless death. If he instead passes the test - the analysis of his brain's responses to the videos - he is told he will be a soldier for the Daemon, and under the Daemon's protection for the rest of his life.  
The fMRI is described as a horrible, forty-six hour long ordeal, where Mosely is well past his breaking point. However, at the end, the videos seem to be building him up instead of breaking him down. When it is over, Mosely is told he is exceptional, and that the Daemon trusts him completely. His new colleagues also say they trust him. And Mosely himself understands himself, through the understanding of the Daemon, and feels elated.
 ","“Why are you here? You’re here so I can determine whether your motivations are compatible with mine.” Sobol gestured as if he were physically present. “The equipment around you is a powerful functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner. It is scanning the neural activity of your brain in real time. Neurons work like logic gates on a computer chip, firing electrical signals in specific sequences to accomplish certain tasks or to conceive certain generalized concepts.” Sobol paused. “It is a controversial fact that technology has discovered a way to see not only truth or falsehood in a person, but their very thought processes in action. Even before they can act upon those thoughts. Dissembling or deliberate deceit is orchestrated by the frontal lobes….”
The frontal lobes were highlighted on the left-hand screen—over the image of what was presumably Mosely’s brain. Other areas were highlighted in turn as Sobol continued, “Fear, aggression, empathy, and recognition all have their unique signatures in the human brain. Mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, also have their telltale patterns. So you see, you can hide nothing from me. I am about to know you better than anyone has ever known you. Perhaps even better than you know yourself.”
Mosely was starting to tremble again. He saw the colors change in the brain diagram on the left-hand screen. He instinctively knew it was fear. He was seeing his own fear develop on-screen in real time. Feeding on itself.
“You are afraid.” (page 258)
;Conflicting emotions swept over Mosely. Adrenaline coursed through his veins as he watched the colors swirling over the image of his brain. He realized that try as he might, he could not biofeedback his way through this. He could not fathom—much less control—the sweeping patterns of color rippling over the folds of his brain. (page 259)
;It was like being dragged over an emotional washboard. Mosely wound up feeling virtually every emotion of which humans are capable—not once but hundreds of times. He was long past his breaking point—not that he even noticed he’d passed it.
The images continued. An unknowable number of hours, and still the images continued. Mosely’s mouth was parched, and he strained to stay alert. The images kept coming.
But one concept had begun to form in Mosely’s mind. Like a rock slowly revealed as a wind blew away surrounding sand, Mosely was starting to see himself. With all his built-up emotional defenses long since worn away, simple truths had begun to emerge. Even he knew their meaning: he was angry at his wasted life. He felt deep feelings of loss that he had no family as a child, and that he had not provided one for his son—wherever he was now. Also Mosely had a desperate desire to belong. To matter. To stand for something besides himself. He was the perennial outsider looking in on the fellowship of others.
The last films were pivotal. Where the earlier ones seemed to break him down to his emotional building blocks, the latter ones seemed to be building him up—filling him with joy as he saw people struggling together. Relying on each other. Sacrificing. Gratitude. Joy. Free men looking toward distant horizons. Horizons that beckoned the adventurous, hinting at danger.
The people in these films were of all races and ages, but Mosely noticed that they shared some traits in common: they were capable, they were highly motivated, and they acknowledged no limits. Danger was not a deterrent. It was life lived to its maximum. They were truly alive.
Suarez, Daniel. Daemon (pp. 263-264). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. 
;Morris nodded and shook his hand also. “Welcome aboard.” “Aboard what?” Rollins gestured. “The Daemon chose you. You’re one of its champions now.”
“Do I have a choice?”
“You already made your choice.” He looked into Mosely’s eyes. “This is where you want to be. That’s why you’re still alive.”
Mosely absorbed the words. The images were so fresh in his mind. Breaking him down to his basic building blocks. Understanding him. Mosely understanding himself. The elation. He realized Rollins was right.

It was a form-fitting conductive shirt worn next to the skin—but it wasn’t a garment. It was a haptic device that helped him use his body’s largest organ—his skin—as another, all-seeing eye. An eye that never blinked, and an eye that could see around him in 360 degrees or halfway around the world, if he wished. It worked by sending tiny electrical impulses to excite the nerve endings in his skin, much like a computer monitor projected pixels onto a screen. The microscopic electrical impulses represented data—from blips on a radar screen to full-blown visual displays. But what amazed Gragg was how the brain learned to accept input from this new source as if it were just another organ. Just another eye. He felt the networks around him, but he could do more than just feel them. Gragg motioned with his gloved hands. Suddenly the headlights of the twin Town Cars flicked on. The cars roared forward and deployed on either side of the road at his command, illuminating the entire crash scene. Gragg halted them with a wave of his hand. (page 334)"

The player sees Markus in a third-person perspective, and the visuals look normal, except when using the android's special abilities, when analysing the surroundings or a body to check it for compatible parts. In these cases, the usually smooth graphics are jagged and distorted, with red lines running through them. The visuals are distorted as though we are seeing through Markus's faulty optical unit. When Markus finds a decapitated android head with a compatible optical unit and picks it up, the head begins to speak: ""Hello. I am an AK700 android. I was designed to serve you. What can I do for you?"" At this point, the player can remove the optical unit from the eye socket and place it into Markus's eye socket, after which the visual glitches are shown to resolve.
The whole scene takes place in the dark, and everything is wet with rain. Several badly damaged androids move around, or ask limply for help. The head of the android Markus takes the optical unit from resembles a skull, the white but black-spotted skin tightly drawn across the bones, but with one gleaming eye staring straight at us. There is very much a sensation of being in a graveyard or perhaps some version of hell. Visually it is reminiscent of a baroque painting.",NA

She hacks the holographic sign of Hjernesenteret, the research centre where her consciousness was scanned before her death, changing it from showing a model of a brain to showing her own face, a little distorted, but clearly recognisable as Oda. She smiles, mildly, and letters are projected: don't be scared don't be scared don't be scared.

Underleppen var fremdeles misdannet, nesen satt ikke riktig, men det var henne, det var ingen tvil, uendelig mye sterkere og klarere enn hun hadde vist seg for ham før. Da han så henne i øynene, kjente han det samme suget han hadde kjent de første gangene de møttes. Ingen i den stadig tettere menneskemengden rundt ham sa noe, de beveget seg bare sakte mot stedet der hun trådte fram for dem, forventningsfulle, forskrekkende, undrende, leende.

Her eyes tell her brain there’s a Caucasian woman in her early thirties with brown hair, blue-green eyes, and a kind face sitting opposite her.

Her nose tells her I use mostly fragrance-free soap, a kiwi-infused shampoo, no perfume, but a baby powder–scented antiperspirant. When I touch her hand or even embrace her, I come off as warm, upright but not rigid, and a good hugger. In return, the chip gives me unlimited access to her brain, including thoughts, memories, learned behaviors, hopes and dreams, worst fears, and all things in between. Utilizing bioalgorithms, I’m able to create a comprehensive neural map of an individual’s mind that can then be used in a therapeutic context to help patients with their issues, large or small.

She is still connected to him through the interface chip he wears on his throat, but he ignores her, refusing to acknowledge her presence and even walking right through her ""avatar"". She tries to get him to follow her upstairs, but cannot move outside of a radius around Jason since her existence is only in the interface chip he wears, and she is disconnected from her servers. 
Her inability to move independently of Jason reminds me of two-player video games where both players are on the same screen, and cannot move too far from each other. ","﻿But he’s found a chair and is sitting down, his face contorting as if he’s puzzling something out. The lie, I realize. He’s still angry about the lie.
“Come on, Jason,” I say quietly, attempting the stairs again. “We can talk about this while we search.”
But I still can’t get to the top step. That’s the trouble with being in interface. I’m geographically tied to the chip. So, if the person wearing it doesn’t budge, I’m not going anywhere either. This is fine in normal circumstances, but if you’re in a fight? I mean, how’s that for a way to force people to engage with one another?
“Jason, I—”
He rises and moves to the stairs without a word. He takes the steps two at a time but doesn’t pause when he reaches me, instead, simply passing through my body as if to remind me how immaterial I am.
That’s how it goes for the next twenty minutes as I’m made to follow Jason from room to room, enduring his silence as he searches for supplies. Only, he does so with such a single-minded focus as if to convince me he’s just that determined and definitely not, 100-percent no-way-at-all ignoring me.
I get it. I wish I had a simulation to blink off into for a while just to give him some space. But I don’t and we’re out of time.

3256,"Emily Eternal (Simulation of world)","When a human wears an interface chip, Emily can see through their eyes and move around the actual world with them. When she is not directly interacting with a human, Emily lives in a simulation of the world that runs on her servers. She has a dorm room that is a replica of a real grad student's dorm room, and she has built a simulation of most of the MIT campus and some of the surrounding city using live data from surveillance cameras and webcams, and still images of places where there are no cameras. The cameras have a 15 second lag so she experiences everything 15 seconds after it actually happens, which can be very frustrating when important things happen.
In this scene, people dressed like soldiers have stormed into the lab where Emily's team works, and Emily rushes in to see what is happening. However, she is not on interface with a human (until later, when Nathan briefly connects with her just before he dies), so is limited to the 15 second delay of her simulation and cannot interact with anybody.
 ","Is Nathan in his office? Or down in the server farm? Then I remember his unreachable cell and decide on the latter. As gunfire erupts on the floor above me, I dash to the stairs leading to the sublevels, pass through the door, and hurry down. I try again to cheat, to leap ahead, but again I’m restricted.
All I can think is, fifteen seconds…fifteen seconds… I finally reach the server bank on the third sublevel, the one that contains my processor and primary memory. I try to determine how far ahead I am of the troops upstairs and lie to myself, saying I have at least a minute. I’ll reach Nathan. I’ll save him. There’ll be enough time. Everything will be fine.

;“Gally!” I cry, but he’s not wearing his interface chip. None of them are. I wonder if they destroyed them. I hear someone tinkering with the servers at the end of another row and run over. I’m relieved to see both Nathan and Dr. Choksi holding tablets, systematically shutting down processes one at a time.
“Nathan!” I cry.
I hear machine-gun fire and screams. Nathan’s eyes go from focused to bleary in an instant. Dr. Choksi, standing up a second before, is now dead on the ground, covered in blood, her shattered tablet in her hand.
I’ve leaped ahead my fifteen seconds. I’m in interface with Nathan now, who stares back at me. He must’ve just switched on his chip. I’ve reached him only to watch him die. The soldiers, not knowing I’m there, swarm around me as they finish off my three beloved techs one row over.

This is described as being viewed through AR glasses, and the second pull quote describes its first launch at a selective conference by Sophia, Dodge's great-niece, and her collaborator.
The AR technology is described in quite a matter of fact way, but the visualisation of the world of the dead obviously entails a lot of more metaphysical subjects. The visualisations improve radically over time, so that everyone on Earth can check in on the  Land and follow its changes, almost as though it is a TV drama. This is also intentionally used for marketing the scanning and uploading of the dead. ","The ancestral home of the Forthrasts was situated in the northwestern quadrant of Iowa: a two-hundred-mile-wide quadrangle defined by Interstates 80 and 90 to the south and north, and 29 and 35 to the west and east. It was now being displayed in miniature, superimposed on a coffee table in an eating club at Princeton University, visible only to Sophia and to the friends she had shared it with: Phil, Julian, and Anne-Solenne. They could see it as long as they were wearing their glasses. They were planning a summer road trip.

;“We asked ourselves, if the memory in the NMA isn’t organized—isn’t used—like neural network memory, then just how is it used? What does it look like?”
“And our answer,” Matilda said, “is that it is used in a spacelike way. It is being used to keep track of a fictional or virtual space with permanent characteristics.”
“Like graph paper?” someone asked. Their tone was not so much skeptical as confused.
“Like a spatial manifold. For which graph paper is a metaphor,” Matilda said. “Because we have access to a vast amount of data, we can say much more about the structure of this space. About what is in it. Sophia and I have brought you all here to show you the results. If you would now please all back up, making a clear area in the middle of this space, I will turn on the spatial simulation so that you can see it.”
The attendees somewhat noisily went into motion, picking their bags up off the floor and shuffling away from one another, clearing a space that grew larger and larger until they were standing around the edges of the court in a ragged oval. Sophia and Matilda had remained closer to the center, standing near midcourt. Matilda’s hands moved in front of her as she worked with some sort of virtual user interface that was only visible to her.
A graph-paper pattern appeared superimposed on the floor. “Just a test pattern,” Matilda said. “Now, the point cloud.”
In one instant, several million motes of green light appeared in the space above the tennis court.
Even though the points were all the same color, and not connected to each other, they were immediately recognizable to the eye as together representing a landscape. In some places, mostly around the edges, the green points were on the floor. In others, in the interior, they were perhaps waist high on a typical person’s body. So the general sense—once everyone had had a few minutes to walk around and view it from different angles—was that they were looking at a three-dimensional terrain map of an island or a continent, bounded all around by the sea, with high land in the middle.
“Ireland,” someone declared.
“Much too mountainous!” someone else scoffed. “Just possibly the Isle of Man? It has a mountain in the middle.”
“This is far larger than that, if you look at all the rivers, the mountain ranges,” said a third. “I’m going to say the North Island of New Zealand? Hard to tell unless we get a ladder and look straight down on it.”
“This is no place that exists on Earth,” said a man speaking in a mild tone of voice but with a calm authority that brooked no argument. Heads turned toward a bald-headed, shaggy-bearded man, who looked to be in his sixties. Through most of ACTANSS 3 he had made a habit of sitting quietly in the back of the room, sans wearable, sometimes paying close attention and sometimes humming to himself as his mind apparently wandered. Through most of the current presentation he had shown a kind of mildly amused boredom, as if finding the subject matter too infantile for words, but when the landscape had appeared in the middle of the room he had been galvanized, and had practically knocked one person over while striding through the point cloud to focus his attention on an interesting feature.
“Pluto’s correct,” Sophia announced. “This doesn’t match against any known—”
“There’s no way that it could. That is obvious by inspection,” Pluto announced. Sophia turned to glance over her shoulder at the bemused Matilda and winked at her as if to say, I told you so! Then she said to Pluto, “Would you like to explain what you mean by that?”
“It’s impressionistic. Not a physics-driven map. The alluvial formations are all wrong. These mountain valleys are V-shaped rather than U-shaped, as they ought to be—no understanding of how glaciation shapes them. The mountains are just high places in the landscape—they have no history. No exposed sedimentary layers, no evidence of volcanism.” Pluto snorted. “This is programmer art. It reminds me of the first maps of T’Rain that Dodge sketched, when he was trying to recruit me.”
“That’s a compelling statement,” Sophia said.
Pluto realized that everyone was listening to him and clammed up.

1841,"Fall; or, Dodge in Hell (VEIL)","VEILs, or Virtual Epiphantic Identity Lustre, are glasses that shine lights on the wearer's face to foil facial recognition systems. Everyone at this point wears glasses providing AR interfaces. Some or all of these glasses also have the VEIL functionality.
The VEIL is only briefly mentioned in the novel, but are significant in its world-building as they are invented by Maeve, who becomes deeply interested in privacy after being the target of extreme hate speech and trolling. The VEIL also connects to PURDAH technology, which allows for anonymous but secure online identities, so that you could use a PURDAH to sign code you had made or a text you had written or to apply for a job while hiding your physical identity. This is an important shift in designing the internet to not be flooded with fake news and trolling. ","On a certain morning in June, Zula emerged from the building’s elevator into its lobby and donned her sunglasses. A yellow ball—the mildest of warnings—flickered in the corner of her vision. She glanced at it. It noticed the movement of her eyes and responded by letting her know that three VEILed pedestrians happened to be passing by outside.
Zula ignored it, pushed the door open, and saw them immediately: three high-school-aged girls, coffee cups in hand, gaily laughing and talking.
They all had wearables with large, reflective lenses, and so their eyes could not be seen. From the cheekbones down, their faces were exposed. But points and patches of light, projected by lasers in the lower rims of the glasses, were flashing and sliding all over their faces in a programmed manner that had been designed to foil facial-recognition algorithms.
Zula wasn’t using a VEIL. By exposing her face in a public area, she had, therefore, announced her location to any camera capable of seeing her and of checking her features against a database. Most people had become accustomed to this a long time ago and did not particularly care. But many preferred to opt out. You could avoid being recognized by wearing a physical veil and a pair of sunglasses, but most people in the industrialized world opted for its information-age equivalent.
To say that Verna and Maeve Braden had invented the Virtual Epiphanic Identity Lustre wasn’t quite right, since it incorporated a number of separate technologies. It had been more of a systems integration and branding play than an invention. But they had conceived it, named it, and made it a thing.
The VEIL was more likely to be worn by persons in the Venn diagram intersection of “young,” “geeky,” and “countercultural.” It was no surprise to find people like that on Capitol Hill. Zula was pretty sure that these three young ladies were on their way to the prep school a few blocks away.

;The third of those interviews—the last thing on her calendar before lunch—turned out to be with her daughter. This was a surprise.
Sophia was wearing a hoodie and jeans, which explained why Zula hadn’t recognized her from behind while walking past the conference room. Sophia had turned on her glasses’ VEIL functionality. Conceivably, Marcus might have recognized her when she had arrived at the Foundation earlier that morning, but Marcus and Sophia had probably never been in the same room together and there was no particular reason why he would have known her.
Zula had reviewed this anonymous candidate’s application more than once over the last several months, and given it a final once-over before she had walked into her office, but it didn’t have a name associated with it. Only a PURDAH. Which wasn’t unusual. Marcus had, in fact, made it almost mandatory. Concealing names, genders, and the like behind a PURDAH was a way to reduce the possibility that candidates would benefit from positive, or suffer from negative, discrimination. So Zula had noted a few points of similarity between this applicant and her daughter, but was nonetheless surprised when Sophia walked into her office, pulled the hood back from her head, took off her glasses, and sat down.

She buys illegal access to the cameras in Riva's house and some facial recognition, but doesn't have enough money to pay for the full suite of tools. She struggles to keep track of Riva. ","Over the last two days, I’ve tried all of the facial-recognition applications I could afford. None of them delivered results. Then I started clicking my way manually through public security cameras. Riva isn’t on any of the streets in her district. She’s not in the corridors, elevators, or waiting areas at PsySolutions. Not in the cafes, clubs, bars, or museums that she visited in the past.
I look for clues in the archive feed from the apartment cameras. Riva left the apartment at 3:13 a.m. She was wearing an inconspicuous outfit, no bag. She looked perfectly normal, as if she were just going around the block to get some fresh air because she couldn’t sleep. But she never comes back. From the security camera at the corner of her block, you can see her walking away in the dark. After that, she never reappears.

2949,"High-Rise Diver (Hitomi watches Riva)","Hitomi Yoshida is a business psychologist tasked with monitoring and counselling Riva Karnovsky with the goal of getting Riva out of her slump and back as an active high-diver. 
Hitomi sits in her own apartment watching Riva through numerous surveillance cameras in Riva's apartment. She has data analysts search through blog posts, papavids and other media to give her more data, and logs minute observations about Riva's body language and state of mind. Riva is not aware that she is being watched until late in the novel. 
When Riva leaves the apartment, Hitomi uses GPS tracking, facetag (TM) and other facial recognition tools to track Riva's movements and watch her through public surveillance cameras. 
For the first part of the novel, the surveillance works flawlessly and Hitomi can track Riva in great detail. ","I zoom in on Riva’s face to get a better look at her reaction. Masters advised me to use facial-interpretation software for my analysis, but moments like these are what I love most about my work. Moments of sudden understanding, like now, when Riva drops her mask of apathetic indifference and her face tells a story. The corners of her mouth shift by fractions of an inch, turn up, a barely perceptible smile. Nostalgic. Remembering better times. Then her eyes widen, she looks up, her jaw tenses, she clenches her teeth together. Her gaze turns to her partner, who still has his back to her. Lips pressed firmly together, a slight retraction of the lower lip.
With such high resolution, the image on the monitor sometimes appears clearer than reality. More precise.
Riva turns away again, looks down at her hands in her lap. Her facial expression returns to its former indifference, resignation. The facial muscles relax except for the eyebrows, which pull slightly together.
—That’s true, she says. That’s what I said back then.
Aston looks over at her, letting go of the picture frame. I select the camera closest to him, so that I can look over his shoulder. See what he sees. Riva on the floor in her summer dress, her hands in her lap, her head lowered. Almost a cliché. The fragile little girl. The damsel in distress.

He is on a mission, which is visualised through the augmented reality he travels through to get there.
He first is shown as though he were a third person character in a videogame, through the camera movement, his actions, and the aesthetic surrounding the situation with bright and solid colours. On-screen, the video of Moritz cycling through a residential street has an overlay that includes a mini-map, cardinal directions at the top of the screen, and spaces for equipped items in the bottom right corner, looking like a video game. There are pink and yellow crystals dotted along the landscape, and progress bars at the bottom for Moritz's rival, Dan, and Moritz himself. Dan's progress bar shows he is far ahead of Moritz, but as Moritz collects crystals, by cycling over them so they fly up and turn into euro banknotes, he gains points and his progress bar fills up, eventually passing Dan's. 
In a way, one could speculate that this in itself—a bicycle ride to his friend to tell him of a plot to get a hold of drugs—is a way to foreshadow the rest of the series. The collectible “crystals” that turn into euros could be seen as a reference to the drugs he is about to collect and sell, and there are weapons around him which may or may not come into play.

While we are following Mortiz through the hallway, we see that most—if not all—of his fellow students are looking at their phones. What they are seeing on their screens is shown to the viewer. This gives an impression that Moritz, the narrator, is showing what modern-day technology is used for: filters and social media. This technology shows up on-screen, following the students, as in a version of augmented reality no-one but the viewer and possibly Moritz can see, or in Moritz’ case, perhaps imagine?
At the moment he mentions “face swap”, the camera that is following Moritz, the “viewer’s eye” into the narrative, is focused on a male and female student, who are using a face swap filter. Once again, instead of us seeing what they are seeing on their phone, the viewer is shown the face swap filter directly onto their faces, as though they had used augmented reality instead of just a smartphone.","Hi, I am Moritz Zimmermann.

In the novel, we see the AR ads on Times Square through Rush's eyes, and","[One chapter in the novel is written like a journalistic feature article on the The Croft in Bristol, and one section is about the vibrant street art] (..) This is nothing new, Stokes Croft has looked like this for decades—but put on a pair of spex running Flex and the art comes alive in ways that seem to warp reality. Buildings strobe with colour while tentacles of paint slither out of the architecture to splatter unsuspecting passersby, herds of rainbow-coloured zebras run alongside passing traffic, and vast, ancient-looking trees explode through rooftops to dominate the skies. They’re the kind of augmented graffiti hacks you might have seen in cities all across the globe, but on an unprecedented scale. “What we do is basically impose zero limits on what artists can create and post,” explains the Dutch artist Anika Bernhardt, the Croft’s “uncurator.” “As long as they stick by a handful of community-agreed guidelines, artists can put art—both digital and paint—basically wherever they like. They’re free to post over or alter other people’s work, even; in fact, we actively encourage it. It’s very much a free-for-all. My job here is less being curator and more a logger or archivist—instead of deciding what art is shown here, I just make a record of it.” I’m intrigued by the way she talks about encouraging artists to post over others’ work. Isn’t that hugely frustrating to the original artist? Isn’t it just a form of vandalism? “We don’t like to use that word here,” Bernhardt tells me. “We want to break that association that art is something that needs gatekeepers, that has to be restricted to galleries. Plus, we have ways of recording all the art, so that it’s instantly retrievable.” She demonstrates this to me, using a part of the Flex app that allows us to delve back in time. It’s a dizzying effect—almost as surreal as the street art itself—as she appears to rewind time, the faces of the buildings changing rapidly around me as murals and AR projections shift and change in reverse.

;and they’re here, swarming around gridlocked traffic and into Times Square. It’s the first time Rush has seen it; Scott had refused to bring him before, saying it’s not somewhere real New Yorkers go. It’s just as awful and wonderful as he’d imagined. Hundred-foot-high superheroes fill the air, punching their cartoon nemeses into skyscrapers that explode into glass-shard blizzards, only to be replaced by hundred-foot-tall anthropomorphic M&Ms, arguing and laughing and falling over, only to be replaced by hundred-foot-tall teen pop stars, peering down at him and smiling over the rims of the latest Samsung spex, only to be replaced by koi carp the size of humpback whales, lazily orbiting a Sony logo built from iridescent bubbles, only to be replaced by hundred-foot-tall NBA legends, slam-dunking— Rush yanks his spex away from his face and the augmented-reality adverts disappear, the towering hyperreal simulations vanishing from the warm night air, but the screens are still there, still everywhere. Some are the size of apartment blocks, some mere tennis courts, but they’re fucking everywhere, everywhere that isn’t a shop front or a Starbucks, on every wall and building. They cycle through brand after brand, from Google to Coke, Delta to Facebook, Hershey to Tesla.

Share prices, breaking news, war atrocities, football scores, celebrity gossip, fake news and real lies. It’s like somebody took the Internet, the hyperactive never-ending churn of the timelines, the constant scroll through Twitter and Facebook and Instagram, and made it real, physical, and nailed it to the walls of the fucking city.

654,"Infinite Detail (Black Lives Matter protest with AR and drones)","Rush participates in a large Black Lives Matter protest in a near-future New York City. He is at first surprised to see all the protesters wearing Spex, internet-connected AR glasses that are easy for police to track, but when he puts on his own Spex he realizes that there are heaps of virtual protest signs in the AR. A lot of personal information about protesters is also visible. Drones are being flown and are surveilling the protests, both owned by the NYPD and by protesters. ","At Rush’s insistence both he and Scott have got their scarves and hoods up to try to mask their faces from the police drones that float constantly above their heads. Most of the rest of the marchers have done the same: if not hoodies or scarves then actual masks—3D-printed re-creations of too many other black men and women slain by the police, to keep their memories alive as much as to hide identities, as if vengeful ghosts have been summoned to march with them. Pretty much everyone is wearing spex, too, which gives Rush some pause. When he jumps into the #blacklivesmatter hashtag channel he can see why they are: virtual protest signs appear floating above heads, demands and slogans, calls to action, tweets from supporters across the globe, and video streams from simultaneous marches in Atlanta, D.C., L.A. But Rush knows for sure that probably most of the protesters don’t have their shit as locked down as much as he does, that they don’t have the same levels of encryption as his custom OS, and that as well masked as their faces might be they’re still leaking personal data, that just by using the spex they’re betraying their identities to the drones sniffing the air above them. It’s not just NYPD drones buzzing around them, though—the protesters have brought their own, of all models and sizes, from tiny, cheap toys to prosumer hexcopters. Illegal to fly in NYC as far as Rush knows, they play a constant cat-and-mouse game with the cops: filming and streaming the crowds, blocking the NYPD drones’ cameras, flashing arrows across LCD screens to show the marchers which way to go as the route dynamically changes to avoid blockades and police lines. Most important, they relay, from tiny Bluetooth speakers strapped to their undersides with string and sticky tape, the never-ending call-and-response chants that the marchers echo back at them. (Kindle loc. 1610 of 4457)
;And then the lights go out. For a nanosecond there seems to be nothing but stillness and silence. Rush breaks off the kiss and they step away from each other, staring into the darkness. The dead screens are the color of the night sky. Every streetlight and crossing signal is out, every shop front dark, every robotic car and bus ground to a halt. He slips his spex back on but there’s nothing—his home-brew OS struggling to connect to nonexistent networks. Something explodes next to them, the crowd nearly knocking him off his feet as they make room for something heavy that’s fallen from the sky, a failed police drone smashed to fragments of plastic and silicone as it impacts the asphalt. And then the silence is gone, the crowd erupting into spontaneous cheering, and Rush finds himself joining in, hands above his head, emptying every last trace molecule of air from his lungs.

As it did before. Everything with a screen will turn on, whether it is plugged in to anything or not.” He stopped walking, looking at her. She stopped too, and smiled a small smile. “Mobile phones,” she said. “Computers, desktops and laptops, televisions, e-readers, all things with screens.” “How?” he asked. “How do you do that?” She laughed. “The knowledge is in you. Ayodele made sure of that. We will explain, later. But for now, just be aware, you are reaching everyone in this city.” She paused. “Unless you’d like it to reach farther?”
He considered it. “Can you make it reach all of Nigeria?” “It won’t be exact, there will be some spillover into other countries, but sure.” “Okay, do it.” He considered his speech. No, he wouldn’t have to change much of what he was going to say. He hadn’t been thinking only about Lagos. He’d been thinking of his entire country. Yes, it was right.

;A woman who’d been walking down the middle of the busy dirt road that passed through the market wanted to throw her mobile phone away. She’d never liked mobile phones. She knew it sounded crazy, but she had always been sure that they could do more than anyone let on. She had a feeling that they could watch you. That they could speak to you at night when you were asleep and brainwash you. “Maybe this is why Ghana is still the way it is,” she’d proclaim. “Because we all use phones and they all control us.” Nevertheless, her boyfriend insisted she carry one. She’d only agreed because he was a sweet, sweet man and she liked the way he spoke Ewe, the language of her mother, whom she missed very much. She’d done exactly what he asked her to do, which was to carry the phone. When he called she answered, but that was as far as it went. She never used it otherwise. She wrapped it in tinfoil and kept it deep in her purse where it wouldn’t harm her. She’d never set her phone to vibrate, but vibrate and vibrate it did as she walked through the market. Finally, she brought the thing out and unwrapped it. It was talking. And it was showing the Nigerian president. It wasn’t made to do any such thing! Her boyfriend had assured her. And what the Nigerian president was saying made her stop and stand still for many minutes. When he finished talking, he disappeared from her phone’s tiny screen and there was the date and time again. Like normal. She frowned, her nostrils flaring. She squeezed the phone. Then she

Marcus tricks the cameras by putting gravel in his shoes to change the way he walks. Later in the book, he has sprained his ankle, and opts not to add gravel to his shoes to fool gait recognition cameras in the city because his foot is sprained, which also alters his gait. 
Cory Doctorow, the author, describes gait recognition in some detail in keeping with his didactic aim of teaching young readers to repurpose technology and fight surveillance and control.","I moved down the corridor lightly and sprightly, keeping my gait even and measured for the gait-recognition cameras. These had been installed only a year before, and I loved them for their sheer idiocy. Beforehand, we’d had face-recognition cameras covering nearly every public space in school, but a court ruled that was unconstitutional. So Benson and a lot of other paranoid school administrators had spent our textbook dollars on these idiot cameras that were supposed to be able to tell one person’s walk from another. Yeah, right.
Doctorow, Cory. Little Brother (p. 6). Macmillan. Kindle Edition. 
;There are a lot of people who walk kind of like you. What’s more, it’s easy not to walk kind of like you—just take one shoe off. Of course, you’ll always walk like you-with-one-shoe-off in that case, so the cameras will eventually figure out that it’s still you. Which is why I prefer to inject a little randomness into my attacks on gait-recognition: I put a handful of gravel into each shoe. Cheap and effective, and no two steps are the same. Plus you get a great reflexology foot massage in the process. (I kid. Reflexology is about as scientifically useful as gait-recognition.)
The cameras used to set off an alert every time someone they didn’t recognize stepped onto campus. This did not work. The alarm went off every ten minutes. When the mailman came by. When a parent dropped in. When the groundspeople went to work fixing up the basketball court. When a student showed up wearing new shoes. So now it just tries to keep track of who’s where, when. If someone leaves by the school gates during classes, their gait is checked to see

2869,"Little Brother (Marcus looks for surveillance cameras)","Marcus explains how to find pin point surveillance cameras in a room using a toilet paper tube and LEDs from a bike lamp.","I went into the bathroom and took off the toilet paper roll and replaced it with a fresh one. Luckily, it was almost empty already. I unrolled the rest of the paper and dug through my parts box until I found a little plastic envelope full of ultrabright white LEDs I’d scavenged out of a dead bike lamp. I punched their leads through the cardboard tube carefully, using a pin to make the holes, then got out some wire and connected them all in series with little metal clips. I twisted the wires into the leads for a nine-volt battery and connected the battery. Now I had a tube ringed with ultrabright, directional LEDs, and I could hold it up to my eye and look through it.
I’d built one of these last year as a science fair project and had been thrown out of the fair once I showed that there were hidden cameras in half the classrooms at Chavez High. Pinhead video cameras cost less than a good restaurant dinner these days, so they’re showing up everywhere. Sneaky store clerks put them in changing rooms or tanning salons and get pervy with the hidden footage they get from their customers—sometimes they just put it on the net. Knowing how to turn a toilet paper roll and three bucks’ worth of parts into a camera-detector is just good sense.
This is the simplest way to catch a spy-cam. They have tiny lenses, but they reflect light like the dickens. It works best in a dim room: stare through the tube and slowly scan all the walls and other places someone might have put a camera until you see the glint of a reflection. If the reflection stays still as you move around, that’s a lens.
There wasn’t a camera in my room—not one I could detect, anyway. There might have been audio bugs, of course. Or better cameras. Or nothing at all. Can you blame me for feeling paranoid?

I am entering these as one scene, as the actions taken (and thus the verbs logged) are the same, although the feelings and circumstances are quite different. 
Grigor did not give the tablet connected to the kidnapped girl to the police, because he worried that it would incriminate him. Instead he gave the police a disconnected tablet and said the battery had run out. The girl took the kentuki that Grigor and Nikolina have used home to her family in Venezuela, and when Grigor connects to the kentuki and sees her with her family, at first he is happy. However, he soon learns that the girl's father plans to sell her again, and he realises she is not safe. He feels that the situation is too challenging, and disconnects the kentuki. 
Emilia, an elderly woman living in Lima, has had a close relationship to Eva, a young woman living in Erfurt. However, Emilia is concerned about Eva's relationship to Klaus, a football player she has managed to identify and called on the phone. When Emilia herself gets a kentuki, the dweller in her kentuki calls Klaus and sends him photos of Emilia in her underwear. He shows Eva, and Eva calls Emilia, making fun of her ""puritan"" disapproval of Klaus, and of Emilia's underwear. Emilia, who has been very emotionally invested in her relationship with Eva, feels so betrayed that she disconnects from the kentuki at Eva's house, and puts the kentuki in her own house under running water so as to destroy it.
In a short vignette, a mother buys a kentuki for her young children, but when they activate it, it screams and screams and tries to attack the children. The mother destroys it.

""So now we're locked in, without a charger? How many hours now?"" ""She's not even fifteen years old, Grigor. She wrote this on a piece of paper and held it in front of the camera.""

On the first occasion, she plays a porn video featuring an old man and a kentuki. The second time, she plays a video of a decapitation. She leaves the room on both occasions, leaving the kentuki trapped with no choice other than to turn itself off or view the videos. She also breaks off her crow kentuki's beak and cuts off its wings.
Much later, we find out that Alina's kentuki is actually controlled by a seven year old child.","Alina paused the video. She didn't know if she wanted to see what came next, but she'd just gotten an idea for something that would finally pull her out of her malaise. She took one of the benches from the kitchen and carried it to the middle of the living area. She put the kentuki in a small ceramic bowl, head down, so it couldn't move. It fit like a ridiculous little hat, but it held the kentuki firmly. She put the bowl on the bench in front of her open tablet. She made a few adjustments to be sure the kentuki could see perfectly, arranging things so that the video was all it could see. Then she pressed Play again.

Her ear and throat jewels went into a dry charger. For the space of three breaths, the world looked and sounded wrong. The feeds added another dimension to her senses, and she had to wait for her brain to adjust to their absence. Welga had an advantage there, too, with her devices permanently inside her eyes, ears, and neck, courtesy of the US military. VeeMods—voluntary modders—paid out thousands in their own coin for similar technology and surgery. Must be nice not having to worry about cleaning or charging or repairing them every day. (p. 46-47)."
3120,"Machinehood (microdrones)","Welga, and most other people, have swarms of microdrones that follow them everywhere. They are used both to give the individual multiple viewpoints and a visual record of their life, and to share a live feed with fans online or their family members. As a shield, Welga has a modest fanbase that give her tips when her fights are particularly impressive. Welga also feels connected to her family because she keeps open feeds from their microdrones and home cameras. ","Privacy had gone the way of the dodo during Welga’s childhood. Some part of her always remembered the cameras. In Marrakech, the caliph’s network blackout had unsettled her more than the potential for violence—the lack of communication, the inability to see and hear what others were doing. It would take a million lifetimes to watch every minute of every public feed, but she had a sense of security knowing that she could look out for her people, and they’d do the same. Losing that had felt like walking around with one shoe: doable but not at all comfortable. (p. 13)
;People used to be ridiculously shy about their personal lives. Bodies did what they did. Her parents had made her cover her knees when they dragged her to Mass, and they told her she’d understand when she was older, but that hadn’t happened. Ironically, her parents’ generation had been the first to deploy camera swarms. They’d been in every public space since Welga could remember, and plenty of homes, too. Door thresholds couldn’t catch every microcamera, and many people in Europe and North America didn’t even bother with them. No one had time to watch every couple have sex. Hell, most people weren’t worth watching. Shields, however, had to look good, and there was no sense wasting an opportunity to earn tips while having fun.

436,"Machines Like Me (AI)","Machine vision is barely mentioned in the novel, which is more concerned with more abstract questions of AI/android consciousness, ethics and emotions. At two points in the novel, however, the first-person narrator, Charlie, wonders how the android Adam sees. (Kindle location 1703)","I still didn’t know whether he actually saw anything. An image on some internal screen that no one was watching, or some diffused circuitry to orient his body in three-dimensional space? Seeming to see could be a blind trick of imitation, a social manoeuvre to fool us into projecting onto him a human quality. But I couldn’t help it: when our eyes briefly met and I looked into the blue irises flecked with spears of black, the moment appeared rich with meaning, with anticipation. I wanted to know whether he understood, as I did, and as Miranda surely did, that the issue here was loyalty. (Kindle location 1043)
;I put my free hand on my hip and looked into his eyes, into the nursery blue with its little black seeds. I still wondered what it meant, that Adam could see, and who or what did the seeing. A torrent of zeros and ones flashed towards various processors that, in turn, directed a cascade of interpretation towards other centres. No mechanistic explanation could help. It couldn’t resolve the essential difference between us. I had little idea of what passed along my own optic nerve, or where it went next, or how these pulses became an encompassing self-evident visual reality, or who was doing my seeing for me. Only me. Whatever the process was, it had the trick of seeming beyond explanation, of creating and sustaining an illuminated part of the one thing in the world we knew for sure—our own experience. It was hard to believe that Adam possessed something like that. Easier to believe that he saw in the way a camera does, or the way a microphone is said to listen. There was no one there. But as I looked into his eyes, I began to feel unhinged, uncertain. Despite the clean divide between the living and the inanimate, it remained the case that he and I were bound by the same physical laws. Perhaps biology gave me no special status at all, and it meant little to say that the figure standing before me wasn’t fully alive. In my fatigue, I felt unmoored, drifting into the oceanic blue and black, moving in two directions at once—towards the uncontrollable future we were making for ourselves where we might finally dissolve our biological identities; at the same time, into the ancient past of an infant universe, where the common inheritance, in diminishing order, was rocks, gases, compounds, elements, forces, energy fields—for both of us, the seeding ground of consciousness in whatever form it took."

It plays upon the idea of the impartial, objective view, the gaze of the coloniser, but also shows that the view is not disembodied but individual and partial. ","""When he ventured forth from the smallroom

1166,"Man with a Movie Camera (Animated movie camera)","Towards the end of the movie (about 59:30 minutes in), we return to the movie theatre from the start of the movie, seeing the audience from above. The camera tripod steps onto the stage, moving without human assistance (stop motion animation), its three legs awkwardly walking to position itself in front of a bench. A case slides along the bench and the tripd adjusts its height down as the case opens and the movie camera comes out of the case and positions itself on the tripod.
The audience is still at first, looking seriously at the tripod, but they start to smile as the camera positions itself on the tripod, and laugh and talk as the camera spins around, spinning all its handles and dials in a little dance. The camera and tripod then ""walk"" off the stage, followed by the case, which slides off camera on the bench. 
The movie camera's dance is obviously done using stop-motion animation, but it is also implicitly compared to magic, through the parallel to an earlier scene in the movie where children watch a magician, and the cutting between the children's laughter and delight and the magic tricks (partly shown by an actual magician, and partly using stop motion animation) is very similar to the cutting between the animated movie camera and the adult audience. (This similarity is noted by Malcolm Turvey in his paper ""Can the Camera See? Mimesis in Man with a Movie Camera, October 89, Summer 1999). The scene also comes immediately after another scene where people watch a performance of somebody playing music on spoons and hands on a piano keyboard. In this previous performance, there is no magic, but there are a lot of film tricks, as the spoons and piano keyboard merge in and out of each other in double exposures, and shots of the audience are intercut with the performance faster and faster. The cuts between the dancing camera and its audience are quite sedate in comparison - but both feature humans delighted by something automated or semi-automated.
Up until this point of the movie, the movie camera is always shown with a human operator. Often the human carries the camera, placing it in new positions. In this animated sequence, the camera moves by itself, although even here, there is a puppet-like quality to its dance, suggesting that somewhere, out of sight, a human operator is still there. This idea is strengthened by the parallel to the magic tricks earlier in the movie. And yet, we do see the movie camera moving, by itself. Not filming, not seeing, but dancing.",NA

The image shivered into focus, nearly three meters from tip to tip. “Casinos here.” He reached into the skeletal representation and pointed. “Hotels, strata-title property, big shops along here.” His hand moved. “Blue areas are lakes.” He walked to one end of the model. “Big cigar. Narrows at the ends.” “We can see that fine,” Molly said.

“This end doesn’t concern us,” Armitage said with his usual utter seriousness.
“Shit,” Molly said, “I’m an avid cyclist.”
Riviera giggled.
Armitage walked to the opposite end of the projection. “This end does.” The interior detail of the hologram ended here, and the final segment of the spindle was empty.
“This is the Villa Straylight. Steep climb out of gravity and every approach is kinked. There’s a single entrance, here, dead center. Zero gravity.”
“What’s inside, boss?”
Riviera leaned forward, craning his neck. Four tiny figures glittered, near the tip of Armitage’s finger. Armitage slapped at them as if they were gnats. “Peter,” Armitage said, “you’re going to be the first to find out. You’ll arrange yourself an invitation. Once you’re in, you see that Molly gets in.”
Case stared at the blankness that represented Straylight, remembering the Finn’s story: Smith, Jimmy, the talking head, and the ninja.
“Details available?” Riviera asked. “I need to plan a wardrobe, you see.”
“Learn the streets,” Armitage said, returning to the center of the model.

Riveria is a psychopath who first collaborates with Molly and Case and then turns against them. He has had his left lung replaced with an implant that allows him to cause others to see holograms. He is known to kill people, apparently almost at random, by showing them terrifying holograms while they are driving. 
At one point Molly and Case watch a holographic performance where Riviera shows himself having violent sex with a holographic replica of Molly. Later, when Molly enters the Villa Straylight, Riviera distracts and attempts to scare her with holograms of her, Case and Armitage, and then of other violent scenes. ","The first of the holos waited just beyond the curve, a sort of triptych. She lowered the fletcher before Case had had time to realize that the thing was a recording. The figures were caricatures in light, lifesize cartoons: Molly, Armitage, and Case. Molly’s breasts were too large, visible through tight black mesh beneath a heavy leather jacket. Her waist was impossibly narrow. Silvered lenses covered half her face. She held an absurdly elaborate weapon of some kind, a pistol shape nearly lost beneath a flanged overlay of scope sights, silencers, flash hiders. Her legs were spread, pelvis canted forward, her mouth fixed in a leer of idiotic cruelty. Beside her, Armitage stood rigidly at attention in a threadbare khaki uniform. His eyes, Case saw, as Molly stepped carefully forward, were tiny monitor screens, each one displaying the blue-gray image of a howling waste of snow, the stripped black trunks of evergreens bending in silent winds.
She passed the tips of her fingers through Armitage’s television eyes, then turned to the figure of Case. Here, it was as if Riviera—and Case had known instantly that Riviera was responsible—had been unable to find anything worthy of parody. The figure that slouched there was a fair approximation of the one he glimpsed daily in mirrors. Thin, high-shouldered, a forgettable face beneath short dark hair. He needed a shave, but then he usually did.
Molly stepped back. She looked from one figure to another. It was a static display, the only movement the silent gusting of the black trees in Armitage’s frozen Siberian eyes. “Tryin’ to tell us something, Peter?” she asked softly. Then she stepped forward and kicked at something between the feet of the holo-Molly. Metal clinked against the wall and the figures were gone. She bent and picked up a small display unit. “Guess he can jack into these and program them direct,” she said, tossing it away.

;She passed a dozen more holograms before she reached the entrance to 3Jane’s apartments. One depicted the eyeless thing in the alley behind the Spice Bazaar, as it tore itself free of Riviera’s shattered body. Several others were scenes of torture, the inquisitors always military officers and the victims invariably young women. These had the awful intensity of Riviera’s show at the Vingtième Siècle, as though they had been frozen in the blue flash of orgasm. Molly looked away as she passed them.

“In Chiba City. He has no left lung. The other is boosted, is how you say it? Anyone might buy these implants, but this one is most talented.” The Mercedes swerved, avoiding a balloon-tired dray stacked with hides. “I have followed him in the street and seen a dozen cycles fall, near him, in a day. Find the cyclist in a hospital, the story is always the same. A scorpion poised beside a brake lever. . . .”

Samantha Martinez is given a hologram ""wedding album"" from the Alternate Universe Intrepid that is the main setting of this novel, where the woman she played on the TV set of Intrepid Margaret Elizabeth Jenkins is married to Officer Jenkins and later died, she is heavily affected by this vision. Referring to her as her sister to strangers and going so far as to spreading the ashes of the hologram when it self destructs. 
Samantha Martinez is bonding with her alternate self, she goes to spiritual guidance for it as has a existential dread moment. 
The hologram can only last for 30 days outside of the Intrepid universe due to so called ""bad writing"" from the TV writer. So Martinez is warned and films/takes pictures of the hologram with her own machines so that she has the contents. The hologram leaves behind a pile of ash which is used as ashes by a dead person by Martinez which she eventually spreads on a beach as she comes to term with the alternate universe self that is dead.

3132,"Remote Control (Sankofa kills drone)","Sankofa has enjoyed living a relatively normal life with Alhaja in RoboTown, but after finding the alien seed that gave her her powers, she buys a delicious plantain and tries to find a peaceful place to eat it in private, but one of RoboCop's drone keeps watching her. She becomes angry at the drone, and beckons it to her and grabs it. Like all technology, the drone stops working at Sankofa's touch. RoboCop is ""distracted"" by the drone being killed and by Sankofa not carrying a phone, and shows a green light at the intersection although a family is crossing the street, and a child is killed as a result. The townspeople become furious, calling Sankofa an evil witch, and she is forced out of the town. ","The palm tree and bush behind her gave some privacy from the busy market. Privacy where human beings were concerned. Robots were another issue. The drone hovered feet away, this time, at eye level. Sleek, black and insectile. It had four propellers on each side and Sankofa could feel the air from their spinning. It was square shaped with dull angles, glinting in the late afternoon light. The glinting was from its many tiny camera eyes embedded all around its edges. As it hovered, the eyes smoothly rotated this way and that.
All Sankofa wanted in this moment was some privacy. To be away from watchful, curious, judgmental, prying eyes. Just for this little moment. She needed to be still and alone … and unwatched. And here this drone was spying on her with its many tiny embedded cameras. She scowled at it and muttered, “Come a little closer, you nosy thing.” Her heart was beating fast, the irritation flowing into her blood. For so many months, the drone had been following her, spying from afar. Now, it had grown bold and was disturbing her delicious meal. This was not the time.
And still, it came closer. Three feet away, now. Two feet. A foot. Sankofa dropped her slice of plantain and grabbed with both hands, making sure to avoid the propellers. Within a moment, it stopped functioning, dead in her grasp. Sankofa grunted with satisfaction, then she felt a sting of guilt.
“Hey!” a man shouted, stepping closer. He was carrying a large bunch of green plantains on his shoulder. “What have you done?”
Sankofa opened her mouth to speak, but she had no words. What had she done?
More people came around the bushes and tree to see. Sankofa threw the drone down, grabbed her food and leapt to her feet. “You see that?” the man was telling another man who’d come running over.
“Eh!” a large woman, carrying several bags said, stepping up. “Sankofa, what…”
“I … it was in my face,” Sankofa said.
“What is that thing?” another woman asked.
“It’s one of robocop’s eyes,” someone said. “Oh my God, it looks dead. She’s killed it.”
“The thing that flies like alien ship?” someone asked in English.
And that was when they all heard the loud crash from the other side of the market square. From the street. People turned to look and without a word, everyone rushed to see what had happened. Sankofa threw off her hijab, grabbed the drone and took off for Alhaja’s house.
As she ran, the world around her blurred from the tears in her eyes and the fact that she could barely breathe. Why am I carrying this thing? she vaguely wondered. But her hands wouldn’t drop the drone. She passed more people, all running in the other direction. When she arrived at Mr. Starlit, people were just leaving the store.
Alhaja was behind the counter. “Sankofa, what happened? I heard there’s been an accident at the intersection! First in decades. Is it true?” She blinked. “Where’s your hijab? You can’t—” She’d noticed the drone Sankofa carried and her eyes grew large. (pp. 117-120). 
;A child had been killed at the intersection. The seven-and-a-half-year-old had been crossing with his mother and two other people. All four people had had mobile phones on them, yes, even the child. Their names were Mary, Akua, Ason and Kweku. They all lived in RoboTown. The robocop had plenty to scan and read on them. None of them were mysteries. Yet at some point as the four of them crossed, the robocop had made a mistake. Some said it had not “been paying attention.” Its head was turned toward the market, many said. And as it had looked toward the market, it had shown a green light while it told the people to cross. The man who’d run over the seven-and-a-half-year-old said he had not seen the child.
How did he not see? Sankofa wondered as she followed the Imam, Alhaja by her side, three men following close behind her, and many of RoboTown’s citizens noisily following behind them. Are the robocop’s false eyes the only eyes he has?  (p. 122). 
;“One has died today on my watch,” it said in its sonorous female voice. “At 14:55 hours in Section 4 of the Kumasi Road intersection. A child, Ason Ayim, age 7 and a half. I said walk and gave Section 3 the Green light at the same time. I made a mistake. I am very sorry for your loss.”
“What made you make this mistake,” Sister Kumi asked, looking right at Sankofa. The robocop whose name Sankofa now knew was “Steel Brother” paused. It looked at Sankofa, as well. And as it did, its remaining drone came down and hovered feet above their heads. “That one there has no digital footprint. How can one have no digital footprint? No device, no face recognition software can recognize, no voice that responds to my voice recognition software. And that one there, she is … that one there, she is … that one there, she is…”
Then Steel Brother seemed to freeze, its massive head turned toward Sankofa. Sister Kumi looked at her husband. “What’s wrong with it?” the Imam asked.
“I don’t know!” Sister Kumi whispered.
“That one there, she is,” Steel Brother said, this time more decisively. “… Confusion. I experience confusion because of her. I spend memory on that one. I burn my energy stores on that one. Trying to understand. For me to do my job, I have to have information. That one there, she is distracting. I was gathering information on that one and that one took my eyes.”
“Your drone?” Sister Kumi asked.
“Yes. And that drew all my attention. And I grew confused. And I made my mistake.” The robot went silent and there was a moment when Sankofa could hear the crickets in the bushes beside the road. Then everyone in the mob began to speak at once—from name calling, to discussing how a robot could make a mistake, to considering the plight of RoboTown now that its robot was stupid.
All Sankofa could think of was the clear fact that the robocop had become obsessed with her to the point of being distracted enough to cause an accident and maybe it was even driving itself mad.
“Get out of our town!” a woman shrieked. Then the first stone flew past Sankofa’s head. “GET OUT!” It was the mother of the dead child. She’d left his corpse, found a large stone, thrown it and was preparing to throw another one. Her wet face was swollen, her eyes red, her nose slick with snot. “BAD LUCK! YOU’RE BAD LUCK! WITCH! EVIL REMOTE CONTROL! SATAN!” She picked up and threw another stone. It hit Sankofa in the leg.

The viewer is clearly meant to identify with the workers revolting against the drones and heavily armoured soldiers. Positioning the viewer visually as a drone works well cinematically with the constraints of a 360˚ video meant to be viewed by slotting a smartphone into a cardboard VR viewer, and also creates a duality that connects the message of revolting against machines that oppress us to our actual world - at the same time as the fascination with technology that is evident in the VR experimental music video itself speaks against the dystopian view of technology.  ","I can see you’re trapped in a maze Let’s find a way to escape

Lights flickered on and Mae saw her name appear on the walls, along with her high school yearbook photo. WELCOME MAE HOLLAND. A sound, something like a gasp, left Mae’s throat. She hadn’t seen that photo in years, and had been happy for its absence. This must have been Annie’s doing, assaulting her with it again. The picture was indeed Mae—her wide mouth, her thin lips, her olive skin, her black hair, but in this photo, more so than in life, her high cheekbones gave her a look of severity, her brown eyes not smiling, only small and cold, ready for war. Since the photo—she was eighteen then, angry and unsure—Mae had gained much-needed weight, her face had softened and curves appeared, curves that brought the attention of men of myriad ages and motives. She’d tried, since high school, to be more open, more accepting, and seeing it here, this document of a long-ago era when she assumed the worst of the world, rattled her. Just when she couldn’t stand it anymore, the photo disappeared. “Yeah, everything’s on sensors,” Renata said. “The elevator reads your ID, and then says hello. Annie gave us that photo. You guys must be tight if she’s got high school pictures of you. Anyway, hope you don’t mind. We do that for visitors, mostly. They’re usually impressed.”

Her father was sitting on the bed, and her mother was kneeling on the floor, his penis in her hand. A small container of moisturizer rested against his leg. In an instant they all knew the ramifications. Mae turned away, directing the camera toward a dresser. No one said a word. Mae could think only of retreating to the bathroom, where she pointed the camera at the wall and turned off the audio. She rewound her spool to see what had been caught on camera. She hoped the lens swinging from her neck had somehow missed the offending image. But it had not. If anything, the angle of the camera revealed the act more clearly than she’d witnessed it.

At her desk, she saw a pair of messages from her parents. They were still awake, and they were despondent. They were outraged.

You are cheerier, more positive, more polite, more generous, more inquisitive. But he had not told her of the smaller, improving alterations to her behavior. The first time the camera redirected her actions was when she went to the kitchen for something to eat. The image on her wrist showed the interior of the refrigerator as she scanned for a snack. Normally, she would have grabbed a chilled brownie, but seeing the image of her hand reaching for it, and seeing what everyone else would be seeing, she pulled back. She closed the fridge, and from the bowl on the counter, she selected a packet of almonds, and left the kitchen. Later that day, a headache appeared—caused, she thought, by eating less chocolate than usual. She reached into her bag, where she kept a few single-serving aspirin packets, but again, on her screen, she saw what everyone was seeing. She saw a hand searching her bag, clawing, and instantly she felt desperate and wretched, like some kind of pill-popping addict. She did without. Every day she’d done without things she didn’t want to want. Things she didn’t need. She’d given up soda, energy drinks, processed foods. At Circle social events, she nursed one drink only, and tried each time to leave it unfinished. Anything immoderate would provoke a flurry of zings of concern, so she stayed within the bounds of moderation. And she found it freeing. She was liberated from bad behavior. She was liberated from doing things she didn’t want to be doing, eating and drinking things that did her no good. Since she’d gone transparent, she’d become more noble. People called her a role model. Mothers said their daughters looked up to her, and this gave her more a feeling of responsibility, and that feeling of responsibility—to the Circlers, to their clients and partners, to the youth who saw inspiration in her—kept her grounded and fueled her days.

If electrifying the water failed, did he mean to send the lightning bolt’s energy into the force field? What would that do, anyway? Nothing? A great deal? Fry us all? The force field must mostly be energy, too, I guess. The one in the Training Center was invisible. This one seems to somehow mirror the jungle.

This situation relates to visibility and evasion, but doesn't explicitly involve machine vision, although one can imagine the surveillance cameras being fooled by the camouflage.","I look more critically at the design on Peeta’s arm.

Then his eyes open, unmistakably blue in the brown mud and green leaves. I gasp and am rewarded with a hint of white teeth as he laughs. It’s the final word in camouflage. Forget chucking weights around. Peeta should have gone into his private session with the Gamemakers and painted himself into a tree. Or a boulder.

961,"The Hunger Games (Ubiquitous surveillance)","Although cameras are never seen, they are everywhere in the arena of the Hunger Games, and there are many in the Capitol as well. In the arena, Katniss knows she is constantly being filmed and watched both by the game masters and President Snow and by the television audience in the Capitol and the Districts. Katniss chooses certain actions based on this knowledge - kissing Peeta to make the sponsors more likely to give them medicine, or editing the story of how she bought Prim's goat so as not to reveal information that might get her friends in trouble.","While I’ve been concealed by darkness and the sleeping bag and the willow branches, it has probably been difficult for the cameras to get a good shot of me. I know they must be tracking me now though. The minute I hit the ground, I’m guaranteed a close-up. The audience will have been beside themselves, knowing I was in the tree, that I overheard the Careers talking, that I discovered Peeta was with them. Until I work out exactly how I want to play that, I’d better at least act on top of things. Not perplexed. Certainly not confused or frightened. No, I need to look one step ahead of the game. So as I slide out of the foliage and into the dawn light, I pause a second, giving the cameras time to lock on me. Then I cock my head slightly to the side and give a knowing smile. There! Let them figure out what that means!

;I want to do something, right here, right now, to shame them, to make them accountable, to show the Capitol that whatever they do or force us to do there is a part of every tribute they can’t own. That Rue was more than a piece in their Games. And so am I. A few steps into the woods grows a bank of wildflowers. Perhaps they are really weeds of some sort, but they have blossoms in beautiful shades of violet and yellow and white. I gather up an armful and come back to Rue’s side. Slowly, one stem at a time, I decorate her body in the flowers. Covering the ugly wound. Wreathing her face. Weaving her hair with bright colors. They’ll have to show it. Or, even if they choose to turn the cameras elsewhere at this moment, they’ll have to bring them back when they collect the bodies and everyone will see her then and know I did it. I step back and take a last look at Rue. She could really be asleep in that meadow after all. “Bye, Rue,” I whisper. I press the three middle fingers of my left hand against my lips and hold them out in her direction. Then I walk away without looking back.

Øyne: brune/grønnne, stirrer tilbake på meg.
Kinn: overstrødd med ein konstellasjon av fregner.

Da jeg studerte fingerneglene, glimtet et minne i lagringsdisken min. Noe jeg lærte på Dag(1): menneskene filte og dekorerte neglene sine med maling.
Men ikkje denne LivsFormen.
Fingerneglene var korte/ujvene/skitne.

2709,"The Old Lie (Is there a night vision camera in the cell?)","William Daniels is an indigenous Australian surgeon being held captive by aliens in The Federation and forced to participate in monitoring painful medical experiments on other humans. He ultimately gives up hope of ever escaping and being reunited with his family, and kills himself.
He wonders whether he is being watched, and hopes no night-vision cameras will stop him, or alert his captors that he is escaping their control.
You could argue that this situation shouldn't be in the database at all, because we don't know whether the night-vision cameras are actually there. I want to include it because it says a lot about the human protagonist's conceptions of the machine vision technology . He sees the technology as potentially watching and if it is there, watching, it has the potential to control him, to stop him from escaping his captivity by killing himself. I also interpret the idea of the possible night-vision camera here as encapsulating William's knowledge that he is trapped, that he has no agency at all, that the aliens have complete power over him, other than possibly in this final act of suicide.
I also want to include the situation because there are so few indigenous Australian science fiction novels, so leaving this one out seems wrong.
I've used the verb ""suiciding"". This is grammatically uncommon (suicide is usually an intransitive verb: to commit suicide, not to suicide) but according to the public online Oxford the transitive use is possible.
In the novel, the power the aliens hold over William is 1) insitutional - the law states that humans are only probational citizens and 2) physical/technological - the doors are locked, the lights are used to torment him, the medical equipment forces him back to life when he wants to die, the night-vision cameras may be watching him. I read the idea of the night-vision camera here as an example of a machine vision technology being a metonym for a whole system of oppression. It also rather obviously relates to Foucault's panopticon, where the knowledge that you could be watched constantly affects your behaviour.","IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE to find a rope. William did his best to twist one from bandages, feared it would not be strong enough, that it would snap, unravel. Nowhere to hide it, he wrapped it around his torso under his scrubs. Someone left the dispensary unguarded for a moment, he slipped a multi-species tranquilliser syringe into the waistband of his pants.
He waited, not knowing if he was being watched, if there were cameras in his room, waited for dark, pretended to sleep, hoped there were no night-vision cameras.

3023,"The Salvage Crew (Amber Rose's cameras and drones)","Amber Rose, the ex-human AI construct in charge of the mission, frequently engages various kinds of camera inputs in spiders and drones. Although his core is a metal box that is in the middle of the landing site, he often spreads his consciousness into other devices that he appropriates, or gets inputs from various sources. He expresses great pleasure in this.
The pull quote here describes him taking control over dozens of spider bots at one through a repeater he and the crew have built, and the rush of seeing through ""over two hundred beady camera eyes"". The sensation is described using sexual metaphors, ""I slide in..."", ""The rush is orgasmic.""   ","Anna extracts the little extension core that goes into the resource extractor. She approaches the thing. It hums and activates, spilling open to reveal a dull insert. She slides in the core and . . . ahh. With an almost sensual feeling I slide in among its idle processors, its circuitry, tapping into the eyes and hands and limbs of every spider it has deployed. Suddenly I am two. No, not two, but ten, twenty, thirty. The rush is orgasmic.
Boomerang dips briefly in the sky as the little repeater takes the load and staggers a little.
AHEM. TESTING. ONE. TWO, I boom from a small army of metal. Milo jumps.
“Holy shit, OC!”
Over two hundred beady camera eyes focus on Anna and Milo. How do I explain this feeling to someone with only one body?
I can’t. The only thing I can offer is my pity for those who are trapped with just two eyes and legs and hands. In these moments I am more. I am legion.

Three, maybe four: the spider’s image recognition, set to near-overfit levels, jumps and classifies even the slightest shadow. One of them peels off. Small, thin, his suit almost entirely peeled off, wires trailing from his scalp. He’s moving in fits and lurches, like the zombie version of a former athlete. One arm looks like it’s been burned off. He’s clutching what looks like a pistol, but could be anything. At least he’s not on a Megabeast: he’s very much alone and on his own two feet.
Wijeratne, Yudhanjaya. The Salvage Crew (p. 151). Aethon Books. Kindle Edition. 
;No sign of those three Mercers. Not yet. Every image processor we have is running cranked up far beyond sanity. We’re overfitting on everything. Once a spider flagged the shadows of two trees as a threat, and I attacked it furiously for a few minutes. But better this than unaware. Every day I send him out, and every day Anna shifts nervously on overwatch, listening for the sound of gunfire. You can imagine my relief when, every day, he returns, hauling either a massive stack of planks or the carcasses of DogAnts.
The trade-off for running Shen and the spiders on high alert is obvious. We have no power anymore during the day. We barely have enough for heating at night. The camp has transformed, overnight, from a reasonably cozy hab into a place we haunt because we have nowhere else to go. Anna and Milo work through the darkness sometimes just to keep themselves warm: her, hammering away on scaffolding, him on our spot probe.

3029,"The Salvage Crew (Seeing world as data)","Beacon, the alien AI, shows Amber Rose what it is and what has happened on the planet through a data transfer. Amber Rose experiences the communication as visual data, ""sketched out"", but where the lines are ""annotations, metadata"". He realises that the large geometric structures they have called ""The City"" are actually the material body of Beacon.  
This situation is difficult to capture in our model, but has beautiful descriptions of how the AI sees the world as data. ","Suddenly, data floods my visual interfaces. Every single input node I have tells me that I’m floating; a camera is a vast, white, empty space. No, not empty.
Towers rising through the ground. The mountain. The valley in front of it. Sketched out in nodes and lines, as in the finest ink. Every line a stream of data. Annotations, metadata I can read, but to read a single line would take me until my faithful nuclear battery guttered and died out; even as I realize this the resolution shifts, somehow, as if the image is aware of my processing limits; the metadata becomes less dense.
The City.
(..)
Silver webs of data, spinning out from the City. Being met by the dumb systems on board the UN ship. Systems that, by mandate, were generations out of date even before they launched.
BUT IT DID NOT SPEAK BACK. IT WAS A FUNCTIONAL MACHINE, NO MORE. SUCH THINGS ARE NOT WORTH MY TIME. 
What could be missiles rising from the surface, each beautifully tagged with its own metadata. The UN ship panics. It fires and changes trajectory. The missiles, aiming with unerring accuracy, end up plowing into the hull and blowing half of it to bits.
And then the Mercers arrive.
I WAS CAUTIOUS.
They land (in the right place, I note disapprovingly) and investigate the one part of the ship we haven’t found yet. Metadata tags swirl around them. I know if I zoom in enough, I will see everything—from their actions to the individual atomic blocks of their construction, all tagged and processed.
THEY WERE LESS ORGANIC THAN YOUR PREDECESSORS. THEY SEEMED ADVANCED ENOUGH TO TALK WITH. 
The City switches part of itself on. A noosphere of data blankets everything.

Fra skjermveggene rundt henne lød den summende lyden av elektrisitet.
«Lys», sa hun med hes stemme.”
Halsen kjentes som et åpent sår. Hun hadde også en kul i bakhodet og ribbeina på den ene siden var ømme og verket da hun satte seg opp. Veggene lysnet, og hun søkte med blikket etter et vindu, eller en dør, men alt hun så, var lysende, hvite skjermvegger i et jevnt kvadrat. Alt som hadde skjedd, raste innover henne og fylte henne med en overveldende angst. 
;Carla fortsatte å rope og banke til stemmen sviktet og neven var sår og vond. Lyset i skjermveggene bølget ustanselig gjennom rommet og hadde tydeligvis hengt seg opp. Til slutt sank hun ned på gulvet og begravde hodet i armene. Hun visste hvor hun var. Hun visste om jenter som hadde blitt sendt hit som straff, om jenter som aldri kom tilbake. Og de som kom tilbake og aldri ble seg selv igjen.
;“Carla stilte seg midt i rommet og så fra den ene til den andre skjermen mens hun ropte, om og om igjen:
«Løgnere!»
Hun grep tak i tallerkenen som sto på gulvet og kastet den med all sin kraft mot veggen. Det føltes fantastisk da tallerkenen knuste og laget en sprekk i skjermen. Hun tok tak i puten og dynen sin og kastet dem også, uten den samme tilfredsstillende effekten. Carla betraktet senga. Den var av stål og hadde hjul, akkurat som en hvilken som helst sykehusseng. Hun tok tak i den og skjøv den med all sin kraft mot veggen. Det gnistret ut av skjermen.
«Jeg hater dere!» ropte hun og veltet senga over på siden.
Carla herpet den. Hun tok hele den jævla drittsenga og smadret den mot veggen, om og om igjen mens hun hylte og skrek som en gal.
Hun visste ikke hvor lenge hun holdt på, men senga var fullstendig ødelagt da hun omsider sank ned på gulvet i en haug av dunete, hvite fjær. Med ett følte hun seg rolig. Hun ble liggende på ryggen og se opp i taket, der en hvit fjær dalte ned mot henne og traff henne på nesa. 
“Snart finnes det ikke fugler lenger», hvisket hun og blåste fjæren vekk.
Hun satte seg opp og stirret på den eneste av skjermveggene som ikke var knust.
«Dere har snart drept alt levende på denne jorden, og da dere fikk mulighet til å rense lufta og redde verden, så valgte dere mer profitt. Det er utilgivelig. Det er forræderi.»
Carla reiste seg og gikk nærmere veggen, hun visste at det var noen som lyttet. Hun stirret på dem. De hadde låst henne inne, de hadde tatt fra henne alt hun elsket. Hun hadde bare ett våpen igjen.
«Jeg skal fortelle dere alt.»
*
Carla satt midt i rommet og så målbevisst inn i skjermveggen mens hun snakket. Hun hadde snakket i flere dager, og nå var det umulig å stoppe. Det eneste hun kunne håpe på, var at hun nådde frem til noen der ute, noen som forsto at denne urettferdigheten ikke kunne fortsette.”
Excerpt From: Nina Borge. “Utbryterne.” Apple Books. 
;Vi har hørt talene dine», hvisket Katarina bak henne.
Carla så overrasket opp, men Katarina hadde allerede trukket seg tilbake og sto oppstilt ved siden av kollegaen. Hadde hun hørt riktig?
;Hun holdt frem hologrammet som viste filmen Katarina hadde spredt.
Klippet viste Carla som satt på gulvet på isolatet og fortalte om Noah, og den urettferdigheten menn måtte leve med hver eneste dag, fordi noen før dem hadde syndet. Filmen hadde spredt seg til alle reduttene, og etter hva hun hadde hørt, fantes det folk på internettkafeer utenfor som også hadde fått tak på dem. Noe var i gjære, noe stort.
«Det har vært opprørsgrupper i mange år, Carla, dette blåser over, som alt annet.»
Noah lente seg bakover i sofaen med det samme filmen var ferdig. Det gjorde Carla vondt å se ham slik. Noah med de kjappe replikkene, og løsningene og planene, som tok styringen og trosset dem alle sammen. Hvor var den rakryggede mannen hun hadde forelsket seg i, han som var opptatt av rettferdighet og likhet, som kjempet hele veien fra Sandefjord til Oslo og som aldri ga opp?
«Hva har de gjort med deg?» spurte Carla og strøk håret hans vekk fra ansiktet.
Noah grep tak om håndleddet hennes.
«Det samme som de har gjort mot menn på den fabrikken i flere tiår», sa han og holdt taket om henne.
Hendene hans var sterke og harde.
«Men vi kan endre det», sa Carla."
2647,"Utbryterne (Carla mistrusts reality)","After Carla has been held in isolation for many days in a room with screens for walls, a woman dressed in white enters the room. Carla doesn't trust her own eyes, and thinks she must be a hologram.
Although the woman turns out to be real, the episode is one of several where Carla learns that the Feminists are not to be trusted. Several of these episodes are visually mediated: the explosion Garm showed her on huge screen-walls turns out to be false. The screen-walls in the cell she is held captive in hide doors and the people watching her. Johanna tells her that the Feminists kidnapped her from loving parents via a recorded message displayed as a hologram, and the holographic displays shows her a photo from a demonstration where she (as a small child) sits on her father's shoulders. ","Carla satt i et hjørne av rommet med armene pakket rundt beina og nynnet på Andrés sang, da døra ble åpnet. Med et sukk gled den opp og avslørte at den hadde vært rett ved siden av badet hennes hele tiden. Carla reiste seg og stirret på kvinnen som kom inn. Hun var kledd i en hvit dress, håret var satt opp i en stram hestehale, og blikket hennes var flakkende. Hvem var dette? En illusjon fra skjermveggen, et hologram, var hun til slutt blitt gal?
«De er klare for deg.» Kvinnen la en sort bukse og en hvit T-skjorte på den ødelagte senga."
2652,"Utbryterne (Fake video of explosion)","Carla is kidnapped by the rebels and brought to their leader Garm, who threatens to blow up the institution where she was raised if she doesn't give him the formula. The walls are covered by screens, and one huge screen shows what appears to be a live video feed of the institution. Carla doesn't believe that Garm's rebels are strong enough to have planted bombs inside the Institution","Ja vel, hvis det er sånn du vil ha det», sa Garm.
Han reiste seg brått og knipset to ganger. Fargene på den ene veggen endret seg. Det knitret over skjermveggen før et bilde av institusjonen der hun hadde vokst opp, viste seg. Den gammeldagse, hvitmalte murbygningen lå i en åsside med skogen i bakkant. Gressbakken der de hadde sklidd om vinteren var brun, og vinden rusket i det som var igjen av de døde trærne.
«Hvis du ikke gir meg formelen, kommer jeg til å sprenge dette stedet her til helvete», sa Garm.
Stemmen hans var hard og uforsonlig.
Carla så forvirret fra ham til institusjonen, overrasket over den plutselige vendingen. Aldri i livet om han hadde eksplosiver på innsiden av redutten. Hun ristet på hodet. Han prøvde å lure henne.
«Tror du ikke på meg?» Garm gikk en runde i rommet mens han så mot bygningen på skjermen.
«Du har ingen muligheter til å sprenge den», sa Carla og hevet haken for å minne ham om hvem hun var.
«Er du villig til å ta sjansen?»
Carla så mot bygningen der den lå i det triste, grå landskapet. En hvit gardin flagret ut av et vindu noen hadde glemt å lukke. Søstrene var nøye på slikt. Ryddige rom, oppredde senger, tellekanter i klesskapet og lukkede vinduer. Hodet ble varmt ved tanken på dem og det utilgivelige sviket deres. De hadde tatt fra henne foreldrene, tatt fra henne barndommen, tatt fra henne kjærlighet og omsorg, og erstattet det med kulde og ensomhet.
«Jevn det med jorden, så gjør du meg en tjeneste», sa Carla, sjokkert over hvor kald hun hørtes ut.
Garm hevet øyebrynene.
«Interessant», sa han og knipset med fingrene.
Rommet vibrerte idet institusjonen eksploderte i et hav av røyk og mur og knuste vinduer. Veggene kollapset innover, og taket falt sammen med et veldig brak. Selv om det skjedde et helt annet sted, var det som om Carla kunne kjenne varmen og trøkket som fikk bygningen til å rase fullstendig sammen.
«Nei!» ropte Carla og løp mot skjermveggen i et desperat forsøk på å stoppe eksplosjonen.
Hva hadde hun gjort? Hun hadde ikke ment at han skulle sprenge den, hun hadde vært sikker på at det var tomme trusler. Full av vantro sank hun ned på gulvet. Den gråsorte røyken steg opp fra ruinene av bygningen. Det var knapt mulig å se at det hadde vært et hus. Hun slo hendene foran øynene. Men lyden var der likevel, den knitrende lyden av brann, og et tungt drønn idet de siste murblokkene falt til bakken. Hvor mange døde under eksplosjonen? Det bodde unger der, helt nede i fireårsalderen. Carla fikk ikke puste, hun fortjente ikke å puste etter dette. Hun hikstet mens hun telte. Tre og tre på hvert rom, femti rom, pluss rommene til søstrene. 165 mennesker.
Hun kom aldri til å tilgi seg selv.
;Carla svaiet, og Noah grep henne om armen for støtte.
«Å herregud, herregud, herregud», mumlet hun og sank ned mot bakken.
Noah holdt tak i henne. Så gikk det opp for ham.
«Det er institusjonen», sa han lavt.
Carlas barndomshjem. Garm hadde ikke sprengt det i fillebiter. Noah visste det var noe som skurret ved historien hennes. Hvorfor i alle dager skulle feministene tillate Garm å sprenge et av de viktigste sentrene deres, selve fundamentet i maktoppbyggingen?
Carla klamret seg fast i ham, og han omfavnet henne mens blikket søkte etter kameraer og soldater."
2643,"Utbryterne (Hologram rings)","People wear rings that seem similar to mobile phones, but with holographic displays. Carla's boss Johanna calls her on a holographic ring, and later, Noah shows Carla a recorded holographic message from Johanna using a ring. Holograms are also used instead of screens for interacting with computers.  ","De fire veggene i hybelen lyste opp, og hun spratt ut av senga. Carla nappet den vibrerende ringen til seg, og presset tommelen mot overflaten for å aktivere den. Et hologram blomstret opp fra ringen, og professor Johanna Bergs ansikt manifesterte seg i lufta foran Carla. Siden hologrammet var tredimensjonalt, følte Carla det som om professoren faktisk var i rommet sammen med henne.
;Hun la straks merke til hologrammet som fløt over Johannas kontrollbord. En blå nedlastningsbar blinket nederst i det høyre hjørnet.
«Hvorfor laster du ned formelen?» sa hun lavt.
;Å ja, så du tror feministene vil det som er best for deg? At de tar vare på deg og beskytter deg?»
Sinnet fikk ham til å skjelve idet han aktiverte ringen sin. Han skulle faen meg vise henne! Et hologram dukket opp i lufta foran dem, og Noah fant frem filen som moren hadde sendt.
«Da foreslår jeg at du tar en titt på denne først!» sa han og ga henne ringen.
;Noahs ring hvilte i håndflaten hennes, og Carla så overrasket på Johannas ansikt da det dukket opp på hologrammet.
«Hei, Carla», sa hun.
Den velkjente stemmen fylte Carla med en overveldende lengsel etter Johannas laboratorium. Hun savnet lukten av kjemikaliene og lyden av forskernes lavmælte stemmer når de snakket inn de nye funnene.
«Jeg håpet det ikke skulle komme til dette.»
Johannas stemme virket mørkere enn vanlig. Bak professoren så Carla de hvite skapene stå på vidt gap, og hun kunne skimte flere knuste reagensrør. Johanna måtte ha spilt inn filmen rett før hun hentet Carla.
;Noah husket adressen til Andy, men siden hologramringen med kartene lå et eller annet sted i skogen nå, ble de nødt til å spørre seg frem. Det tok noen timer, men til slutt fant han en bygning som så kjent ut.
;I enden av korridoren lå kontrollrommet. Det var vinduer på alle kanter slik at det var fritt innsyn til alt som foregikk der inne. To hvitkofter satt ved hvert sitt kontrollbord med svevende hologrammer foran seg. Begge virket fullstendig fordypet i arbeidet sitt, og Noah betraktet kontrollsentrene deres med en viss engstelse. Hologramteknologi var nytt for ham, men han visste at de gamle glass-skjermene fra før Kina-krigen var forgjengerne til disse. Det var ikke umulig for ham å ta ned brannmuren, hvis han bare fikk litt tid på seg. De måtte også laste opp formelen og få den sendt ut til Louisa Fischer og de andre forskerne."

He believes that the IT department has fooled the silo's residents into believing that the outside world is toxic. He cleans the lenses of the cameras that capture the images of the outside world out of pity for the people still left inside the silo. 
But after a few minutes, he feels sick. Thinking there is too little air in the survival suit, he manages to smash it with a rock and remove the helmet. But when he takes off the helmet and looks at the world with his own unaided eyes, he sees that the world is in fact brown and gray, the skyscrapers are broken, and the body of his wife, who left three years earlier, is lying on the hillside next to him. 
In this series, technology or the lack of technology is consistently used to keep the people subdued and to avoid an uprising. The screens in the silo never show the outside world quite as it is, because of dirt on the lenses and dead pixels on the screens. Holston then comes to distrust the images shown as he finds documents showing that the world outside is not really toxic. This appears to be confirmed when he steps outside, but then when he removes the helmet he discovers that the green lushness was a deception too.

At the top of the ramp, Holston saw the heaven into which he’d been condemned for his simple sin of hope. He whirled around, scanning the horizon, his head dizzy from the sight of so much green!
Green hills, green grass, green carpet beneath his feet. Holston whooped in his helmet. His mind buzzed with the sight. Hanging over all the green, there was the exact hue of blue from the children’s books, the white clouds untainted, the movement of living things flapping in the air.
Holston turned around and around, taking it in. He had a sudden memory of his wife doing the same; he had watched her awkwardly, slowly turning,

What he got instead was like a punch to the chest. Holston gagged. He threw up spittle and stomach acid, the very lining of him trying to flee. The world around him had gone brown. Brown grass and gray skies. No green. No blue. No life.
He collapsed to one side, landing on his shoulder. His helmet lay open before him, the visor black and lifeless. There was no looking through the visor. Holston reached for it, confused. The outside of the visor was coated silver, the other side was nothing. No glass. A rough surface. Wires leading in and out of it. A display gone dark. Dead pixels.
He threw up again. Wiping his mouth feebly, looking down the hill, he saw the world with his naked eyes as it was, as he’d always known it to be. Desolate and bleak. He let go of the helmet, dropping the lie he had carried out of the silo with him. He was dying. The toxins were eating him from the inside. He blinked up at the black clouds overhead, roaming like beasts. He turned to see how far he had gotten, how far it was to the crest of the hill, and he saw the thing he had stumbled into while crawling. A boulder, sleeping. It hadn’t been there in his visor, hadn’t been a part of the lie on that little screen, running one of the programs Allison had discovered.

;“What am I holding?” she asked, waving the scroll of printout.
“It’s a program,” he whispered.
“You mean like a timing circuit? Like a—?”
“No, for a computer. A programming language. It’s a—” He looked away. “I don’t want to say. Oh, Jules, I just want to go back to Mechanical. I want none of this to have happened.”
These words were like a splash of cold water. Scottie was more than frightened—he was terrified. For his life. Juliette got off the desk and crouched beside him, placed her hand on the back of his hand, which rested on his anxiously bouncing knee.
“What does the program do?” she asked.
He bit his lip and shook his head.
“It’s okay. We’re safe here. Tell me what it does.”
“It’s for a display,” he finally said. “But not for like a readout, or an LED, or a dot matrix. There are algorithms in here I recognize. Anyone would …”
He paused.
“Sixty-four-bit color,” he whispered, staring at her. “Sixty-four bit. Why would anyone need that much color?”
“Dumb it down for me,” Juliette said. Scottie seemed on the verge of going mad.
“You’ve seen it, right? The view up top?”
She dipped her head. “You know where I work.”
“Well, I’ve seen it too, back before I started eating every meal in here, working my fingers to the bone.” He rubbed his hands up through his shaggy, sandy-brown hair. “This program, Jules—what you’ve got, it could make something like that wallscreen look real.”
Juliette digested this, then laughed. “But wait, isn’t that what it does? Scottie, there are sensors out there. They just take the images they see, and then the screen has to display the view, right? I mean, you’ve got me confused, here.” She shook the printed scroll of gibberish. “Doesn’t this just do what I think it does? Put that image on the display?”
Scottie wrung his hands together. “You wouldn’t need anything like this. You’re talking about passing an image through. I could write a dozen lines of code to do that. No, this, this is about making images. It’s more complex.”
He grabbed Juliette’s arm.
“Jules, this thing can make brand-new views. It can show you anything you like.”
He sucked in his breath, and a slice of time hung in the air between them, a pause where hearts did not beat and eyes did not blink.
Juliette sat back on her haunches, balancing on the toes of her old boots. She finally settled her butt on the floor and leaned back against the metal paneling of his office wall.
“So now you see—” Scottie started to say, but Juliette held up her hand, hushing him. It had never occurred to her that the view could be fabricated. But why not? And what would be the point?

2793,"Wool (Watching outdoors on screens)","The walls of the top level of the underground silo are covered with large screens showing the outside world. The images are captured by cameras above ground, and the camera lenses get grimy with dirt that is only cleaned off when an expelled resident of the silo cleans the lenses with a pad of wool before walking off to their death.
While in the holding cell before leaving the silo, Holston notices dead pixels on the screen, and imagines a future where most of the pixels will be dead. These screens are the residents' only images of the outside world, apart from drawings and photos in old children's books from long ago, and so he imagines that the few remaining true pixels in the future might be taken for the ones that are broken.
Holston has recently found the documents that caused his wife to believe that the world outside is in fact not toxic, and that the images on the screens are fake. This scene not only expresses his own distrust in the technologically mediated view of the outside world, it also explores how human interpretation of technology can also be flawed - hundreds of years later, when nobody remembered how the technology was supposed to work, how would people know what was a true pixel and what was a broken one? ","The view of the dead world filled up the entire wall of his cell, just like all the walls on the silo’s upper level, each one full of a different slice of the blurry and ever-blurrier wasteland beyond. Holston’s little piece of that view reached from the corner by his cot, up to the ceiling, to the other wall, and down to the toilet. And despite the soft blur—like oil rubbed on a lens—it looked like a scene one could stroll out into, like a gaping and inviting hole oddly positioned across from forbidding prison bars. The illusion, however, convinced only from a distance. Leaning closer, Holston could see a handful of dead pixels on the massive display. They stood stark white against all the brown and gray hues. Shining with ferocious intensity, each pixel (Allison had called them “stuck” pixels) was like a square window to some brighter place, a hole the width of a human hair that seemed to beckon toward some better reality. There were dozens of them, now that he looked closer. Holston wondered if anyone in the silo knew how to fix them, or if they had the tools required for such a delicate job. Were they dead forever, like Allison? Would all of the pixels be dead eventually? Holston imagined a day when half of the pixels were stark white, and then generations later when only a few gray and brown ones remained, then a mere dozen, the world having flipped to a new state, the people of the silo thinking the outside world was on fire, the only true pixels now mistaken for malfunctioning ones.

The camera moves into the target and when the impact takes place the image disappears and turns in to white-noise indicating that the camera is destroyed. The projectile it was attached to has hit the target. These images are from the 1991 US war against Iraq. The images are juxtaposed with the text: Images from flying projectiles, Images from suicide cameras (1:09-1:31). The machine vision is destroyed in the process of achieving its goal to destruct its target.",NA

Adak asks Amaro if she wants to hear the podcast with the news. Unable to respond verbally, Adak tries to interpret her facial expression. Amaro questions Adak's emotional recognition abilities. ","""She wanted to say no, but could not find her voice. A security camera blinked beside the speaker, enabling Adak to see her face, and she must have had an expression that Adak interpreted to mean she wanted to hear the news, so the podcast started. 
The podcast was only about sixty seconds, a teaser to urge listeners to watch the longer version on video. Once it ended, the music did not resume and Adak did not ask her if she wanted to watch the whole news because, this time, Adak correctly interpreted her expression. 
She wanted to look into a mirror and see what her avatar was seeing. She knew it could not read her mind, though some people assumed their avatars had this supernatural ability. It was smart enough to figure out that she was thinking about the only ‘family’ photo from her childhood, but was it not smart enough to know the confusing emotions now raging inside her?"""

488,"Years and years (Broadcast deepfake issue)","Daniel is watching the news, after his sister suggests a way to smuggle his boyfriend out of Spain and back into England. He lies on the bed, desolutely switching through news broadcasts. The news anchor shows two examples of deepfake videos of politicians. The anchor asks Vivienne Rook whether she agrees that the videos are fake and she says yes, but that they did really say those things. Later Rook is elected prime minister of Great Britain. (Episode 4, about 16 minutes in)
Viv Rook is shown as hugely benefitting from the deep fakes - she has apparently not been targeted herself, and she certainly knows how to frame the deepfakes to her benefit (they're fake - but true!). This is a parallel to how some politicians benefit from bot farms and paid trolls today, claiming no responsibility - yet they benefit from the situation. Also note the contrast between Daniel lying sad on the sofa, in the dark, zapping between channels, and these outrageous stories. Seeing this news story apparently spurs him to decide to go and rescue his boyfriend - there's no clear causality, but the events are certainly positioned together in time.","News anchor: So you are saying these videos are fake? Vivienne Rook: ""Oh of course they’re fake videos, anyone can see that, they’re not real! All the same. They really did say those things…didn’t they?"""
