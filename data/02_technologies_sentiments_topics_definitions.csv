Term,Type,Definition
3D scans,Technology,"3D images or models produced by surface scanning such as photogrammetry, LiDAR, 3D scanning, etc. Does not usually include holograms unless the surface scan that produced the hologram is presented as particularly important in the game."
AI,Technology,"Artificial intelligence systems that can perform a broad range of intellectual and cognitive tasks that humans can. A system that can only perform one task, such as facial recognition, video recommendations, conversations with humans, or playing a game, is not general-purpose AI, but is likely to use machine learning."
Augmented reality,Technology,"Digital images overlay or appear to be integrated into a physical environment. Unlike holograms, glasses, implants or screens are usually required to view AR.    "
Biometrics,Technology,"Technologies used to identify an individual. Can include retina scans, gait recognition, DNA phenotyping, fingerprint scans.  Facial recognition is not included here but tagged separately."
Body scans,Technology,"Any imaging technology that shows parts of the body that are usually hidden, for instance brain imaging, fMRI, ultrasound, x-ray, or body scans in airport security that show objects under clothing. Includes cameras probes that enter the body."
Camera,Technology,"Single-purpose, portable camera technologies for creating a visual representation, e.g., camcorders, SLR cameras, cinema cameras. Does not include CCTV, satellites or cameras that are part of other technologies, such as webcams and camera phones, and does not include cameras that produce non-visual information such as motion tracking."
Cameraphone,Technology,Cameras integrated into phones that are easily carried on the person and often include computational capabilities.
Deepfake,Technology,"Technologies that use machine learning to generate videos that strongly resemble a specific human being. For our purposes, we include for instance art, satire, spoofs, and porn, but not professional uses of synthetic or virtual actors in Hollywood movies."
Drones,Technology,Remote controlled or autonomous aerial vehicle with a camera. Does not carry a human operator.
Emotion recognition,Technology,Software that analyses facial expressions to infer a person's emotions and inner states of mind.

Highly sexualised appearance alone is about the protagonist, and should not be tagged in themes, unless it is clearly also a theme."
Grief,Topic,Emotional responses to loss.
Hacking,Topic,"Topics use Hacking in a broader cultural sense, including technical hacking (both illegal cracking and hacking technical systems), as well as cultural hacks, life hacks and artist hacks that are more playful ways to trick, repurpose, subvert or obfuscate a system. James Brindle's Autonomous Trap 001 and !Mediengruppe Bitnik DELIVERY FOR MR. ASSANGE are Hacking. Note: Tag situations with more granular verbs, so hacking in situation will be restricted to technical hacks (as repurposing existing technology for purposes it was not originally intended for). Cracking can be used when it is illegal. For cultural hacks we use verbs such as: Repurposing, Subverting, Obfuscating, Tricking, Pranking etc."

Can include non-human or fictional groups, e.g., Captain Marvel, which presents racism again the Skrulls, or Binti, where a fictional African group of people are oppressed by other humans and by aliens. Brave New World would not qualify for the tag “Race and ethnicity” if it had machine vision, but rather for “Inequality”."
