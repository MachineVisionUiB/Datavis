  This is a static HTML and CSS archive of the Database of Machine Vision in 
  Art, Games and Narratives, which
  captures cultural attitudes towards
  machine vision technologies as they are expressed
  in art, games and narratives. 
  
  The database includes
  records of 500 creative works (including 77 digital
  games, 191 digital artworks and 236 movies, novels
  and other narratives) that use or represent machine
  vision technologies like facial recognition,
  deepfakes, and augmented reality.

  Data was collected by a team of topic experts who
  followed an analytical model developed to explore
  relationships between humans and technologies,
  inspired by posthumanist and feminist new
  materialist theories. The project team identified
  relevant works by searching databases, visiting
  exhibitions and conferences, reading scholarship,
  and consulting other experts. The inclusion
  criteria were creative works( art, games,
  narratives (movies, novels, etc)) where one of the
  following machine vision technologies was used in
  or represented by the work: 3D scans, AI, Augmented
  reality, Biometrics, Body scans, Camera,
  Cameraphone, Deepfake, Drones, Emotion recognition,
  Facial recognition, Filtering, Holograms, Image
  generation, Interactive panoramas Machine learning,
  MicroscopeOrTelescope Motion tracking, Non-Visible
  Spectrum Object recognition, Ocular implant,
  Satellite images, Surveillance cameras, UGV,
  Virtual reality, and Webcams.
