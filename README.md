## Machine Vision in Art, Games and Narratives: Data, Scripts and Visualisations

This repository gathers data exports, scripts, documentation and visualisations based on data collected in the database [Machine Vision in Art, Games and Narratives](https://machine-vision.no) as part of the [ERC-funded project Machine Vision in Everyday Life: Playful Interactions with Visual Technologies in Digital Art, Games, Narratives and Social Media](https://www.uib.no/en/machinevision/).

The dataset captures cultural attitudes towards machine vision technologies as they are expressed in art, games and narratives. It includes records of 500 creative works (including 77 digital games, 191 digital artworks and 236 movies, novels and other narratives) that use or represent machine vision technologies like facial recognition, deepfakes, and augmented reality.

This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 771800).
