# Set working directory and load tidyverse---------------------------------------------------

# These scripts assume that the data files are in the a subdirectory
# of your working directory called data. 
# 
#getwd()
#setwd()

# These scripts use the Tidyverse package. If you haven't already installed that, 
# remove the # from the following line and run it.

#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

# Import creativeworks ----------------------------------------------------

# Simplify character traits -----------------------------------------------

# Change some of the variables to simplify for analysis. This example merges 
# black, person of colour, indigenous, immigrant and complex into one category:
# PoC, and merges machines and cyborgs into a value called Robot. Since our
# categories for race and ethnicity do not follow the specific demographic 
# categories of a country, and there are very few cases of some of the values 
# like indigenous), for some analyses combining categories will be better. 
# The code can easily be adapted to combine or rename categories differently.
# 
# Format here is:
# mutate(New_column_name = recode(Old_column_name, "New value" = "Old value"))
# 
# Could remove customizable characters with this line:
#         filter(IsCustomizable == FALSE) %>% 
# 
# Convert "Unknown" values to NA. 
# 
# Select relevant columns.
